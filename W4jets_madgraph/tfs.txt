Dear Colleagues:

During our last meeting we have discussed in some detail what needs
to be done in order to derive jet transfer functions for the W + 4 jets
matrix element code. I would also like to recap the remaining functions
that have to be derived from MC simulations:

1) Jet reconstruction efficiencies. Just like transfer functions, these
   have be derived as functions of tree-level parton Pt values in various
   eta bins.

2) The transverse momentum prior for the W + 4 jets system. My assumption
   is that this prior can, in principle, depend on the observed quantities
   (such as HT, etc) but this dependence should be mild in order not to
   introduce another JES-related systematic uncertainty. It would be
   interesting to understand if this prior could be sharpened by considering
   the recoil (i.e., everything else visible in the detector besides the
   lepton and the four leading jets). I remember that, for ttbar, we found
   very little correlation between the Pt of the recoil and the "true" Pt
   of the ttbar system (determined from HEPG), so we ended up using
   a transverse momentum prior which was centered at (0,0) and did not
   change event-by-event (this prior did depend on the top mass, however).
   For W + jets, the recoil situation might be different.

3) The transfer function for the tau. This is, basically, just the fraction
   of the tau momentum carried away by the charged lepton in the decay
   tau -> l nu nu (we will assume that the directions of the tau and
   the lepton are the same). This fraction depends on the tau polarization
   and can, in principle, be different for ttbar and W+jets.

I hope that Igor S. and George will soon figure out how to get the relevant
info from the W + jets HEPG banks.

Regards,
Igor
