Normalization factors are applied as follows:

The jet transfer functions are Dirac deltas in eta and phi. The partons
are considered massless. Then p^2 d p d Omega/E = p d p d Omega = 
pT d pT d eta d phi. Thus, after integration with deltas, there is
a remaining pT term per jet which is applied inside "integrateW4Jets",
in the same cycle where the event weight is multiplied by the weight
from the W mass scan.

For the neutrino, we use a flat prior in the d^3 p space. This leaves
the 1/E term which is applied inside "weightForKnownWMass". The jacobian
for d mw^2/d nu_pz is applied inside "weightForKnownWMass", together
with the division by W sampling density (because matrix element includes
the W mass propagator factor).

The flux factor is applied inside "matrixElementWeight", together with
the proton structure functions (which are applied by VECBOS). This
is consistent with the flux use in VECBOS.

The normalization is somewhat tricky for the charged lepton because
it has to be consistent between W -> l nu and W -> tau nu. We will
assume that, for  W -> l nu, the transfer function looks like
delta(cos(theta)) delta(phi) delta(p). Then, after integration over
p^2 d p d Omega/E, one "p" factor is left. This factor is applied
inside the "if (allowDirectDecay)" branch of the W mass scan, function
"integrateW4Jets".

For integration over tau, we will assume the transfer function that looks 
like f(p_l|p_tau) = delta(cos(theta)) delta(phi) 1/p_tau g(p_l/p_tau).
Then f(p_l|p_tau) p_tau^2 d p_tau d Omega/E_tau -> g(p_l/p_tau) d p_tau.
The integration will perform the averaging over g(p_l/p_tau) (together
with the rest of the things) multiplied by (p_tau_max - p_tau_min).
Thus there is no additional normalization term left. Multiplication
by (p_tau_max - p_tau_min) is performed inside the "if (allowTau)" branch
of the W mass scan, function "integrateW4Jets".
