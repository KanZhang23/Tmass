Running the test project:

1) Generate the data to be processed by running the "test_project_gen.tcl"
   script.

2) Modify the "datadir" variable at the beginning of the
   "test_project_config.tcl" file so that it points at the directory
   where the files generated in the previous step are.

   The command which the system will be running per work chunk (ntuple row)
   is "sum_columns 2" (see file test_project_config.tcl). The second parameter
   here is just a delay in seconds per chunk. With value of 0, the system
   will work very quickly, and you simply will not be able to start multiple
   workers as the first worker will immediately process everything. Value
   of 0 can be more useful in case you are using this test project to debug
   system access permissions in "../allowed_hosts.tcl". There will be 30
   and 60 work chunks in the test input files, so finishing the project
   should take the system about 1.5 minutes with the default 2 second delay
   and two active workers (assuming that you don't interrupt a worker as
   described in step 7).

3) Make sure the unique integer server is running.

4) Start the director:

   nohup ../director.tcl "test" test_project_config.tcl test_project_config.log 50000 >& director.log &

5) Start the master:

   nohup ../master.tcl localhost 50000 >& master.log &

6) Start couple workers:

   nohup ../worker.tcl localhost 50000 >& worker0.log &
   nohup ../worker.tcl localhost 50000 >& worker1.log &

7) See what happens when a worker gets an interrupt signal.
   Nothing terrible should happen actually, the system should
   be able to handle this situation gracefully.

   kill -INT `ps auxww | grep worker.tcl | grep tclsh | awk '{print $2}' | tail -1`

   You can also try "kill -9" instead of "kill -INT". This
   will increase the test time significantly as the system
   will have to wait until worker timeout expires (this timeout
   is set by the "chunk_timeout_sec" variable in ../mw_utils.tcl).

8) Wait until the director script exits.

9) Examine various log files, in particular test_project_config.log.
