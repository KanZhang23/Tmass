  npstat/stat/Filter1DBuilders.hh). The "BoundaryMethod" enum has been

* Added high-level driver function "simpleVariableBandwidthSmooth1D" to
  automatically build the pilot estimate for "variableBandwidthSmooth1D".

* Swithched to log of sigma as Minuit parameter in "minuitFitJohnsonCurves"

* Improved (again) random number generator for the 1-d Gaussian distribution.
  Something about expectation values of normalized Hermite polynomials over
  random numbers made by this generator is still not fully understood. The
  standard deviation of these expectations decreases with the polynomial
  order (while it should stay constant). It is possible that the numbers
  of points used are simply insufficient to sample the tails correctly.

* Implemented smoothed expectation-maximization (a.k.a. D'Agostini) unfolding

  persistent.

  methods are more efficient than transpose followed by multiplication.


Version 2.6.0 - January 30 2014, by I. Volobouev

* Added function "lorpeBackgroundCVDensity1D" which linearizes calculation
  of the cross validation likelihood in semiparametric fits. Argument
  "linearizeCrossValidation" was added to MinuitSemiparametricFitFcn1D
  constructor, "lorpeBackground1D" function, etc.

* Added the ability to build filters with center point removed to classes
  WeightTableFilter1DBuilder and StretchingFilter1DBuilder. The function
  "symbetaLOrPEFilter1D" now has an appropriate switch.

  dereference for some member).


Version 2.0.0 - June 15 2013, by I. Volobouev

* Updated to use "Geners" version 1.3.0. A few interfaces were changed
  (API for the string archives was removed because Geners own string archive
