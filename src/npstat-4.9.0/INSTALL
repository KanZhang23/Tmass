The NPStat package depends on several other packages which must be
installed first:

1) Double precision version of the FFTW library from www.fftw.org

2) The "Geners" package from http://geners.hepforge.org/

3) The "KSTest" package from http://kstest.hepforge.org/

4) LAPACK and BLAS libraries liblapack.so and libblas.so (installed
   on many systems by default).

If these packages are not yet installed on your machine, please
install them first following the instructions in their corresponding
INSTALL files.

A few NPStat algorithms need an external minimization engine. These
algorithms can be easily accessed if the Minuit2 minimization package
is installed (see http://www.cern.ch/minuit/) However, Minuit2 is not
needed in order to compile NPStat -- Minuit2 is interfaced to NPStat
via header files only.

Set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the name of the
directory where the FFTW and Geners libraries install their package
configuration files "fftw3.pc" and "geners.pc", respectively. Usually,
this directory is /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig.

After this, a typical NPStat installation can proceed as follows:

./configure --with-pic
make
make install

The last step may have to be performed as root. Run

./configure --help

to view available configuration options.
