This directory contains the following examples:

lorpe_1d           -- LOrPE example in one dimension. Generates a data
                      sample by Monte Carlo and filters it.

apply_lorpe_1d     -- A more full-featured LOrPE example in one dimension
                      which can be used to smooth user-provided data.
                      Supports several different types of bandwidth choices.

lorpe_multivariate -- LOrPE example in two dimensions.

n_poly_coeffs      -- Calculate how many coefficients an arbitrary-dimensional
                      polynomial has.

ems_unfold_1d      -- Expectation-maximization unfolding with smoothing for
                      a one-dimensional distribution.

dump_qmc           -- Prints higher-order Sobol quasi-Monte Carlo points to
                      the standard output.
