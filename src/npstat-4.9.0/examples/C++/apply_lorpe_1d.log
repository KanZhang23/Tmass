  power         power of the symmetric Beta kernel. Use a negative number
                here in order to employ the Gaussian kernel.

  degree        LOrPE polynomial degree to use. Use a negative number here in
                order to use the polynomial degree from the AMISE plugin rule.

  bandwidth     LOrPE bandwidth to use. Use zero or a negative number here
                in order to use the bandwidth from the AMISE plugin rule.

  b_method      The type of boundary correction to perform for the kernel.
                Should be one of BM_TRUNCATE, BM_STRETCH, BM_FOLD, BM_CONSTSQ, BM_FOLDSQ, BM_CONSTVAR or BM_FOLDVAR.

  n_intervals   Number of intervals to use for splitting the density support.

  x_min, x_max  Density support interval. Data points outside of this interval
                will be ignored.

  input_file    The input file which contains data columns separated by white
                space. Lines which start with the "#" character are ignored.

  input_column  The column number in the input file for which LOrPE density
                estimation should be performed.

  output_file   The name of the output file. This file will contain two
                columns: the interval center will be in the first column
                and the estimated density will be in the second column.
