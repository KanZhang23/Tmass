Version 1.11.1 - March 27 2017, by I. Volobouev

* Fixed a problem with missing cmath header include statement in
  "tuple_collections.cc" which shows up in newer g++ versions.


Version 1.11.0 - February 10 2017, by I. Volobouev

* Added a method which efficiently retrieves the collection of categories
  from an archive.

* Added "isStrictlyIncreasingSeq" utility function (used in the above).


Version 1.10.0 - October 15 2015, by I. Volobouev

* Allowed gs_specialize_template_id_T... macros to work with external
  classes not wrapped for "geners" in case their MAX parameter is
  less than the total number of template parameters.


Version 1.9.0 - June 1 2015, by I. Volobouev

* Published the "Base" type in DefaultReaderWriter class (this can be
  used by the "read_base_obj" function in binaryIO.hh).

* Inlined a number of trivial destructors.


Version 1.8.0 - Apr 30 2015, by I. Volobouev

* Fixed "unused parameter" warnings in "geners/arrayIO.hh".

* Added "gssa_merge" program in the "tools" directory which merges
  string archives saved in .gssa or .gssaz files.

* Added "unregisterClass" method to the StaticReader template and
  "unregisterWrapper" method to the StaticReaderWriter template. These
  methods are needed for dynamical unloading of shared libraries.


Version 1.7.0 - Apr 11 2015, by I. Volobouev

* Made StaticReader::registerClass method exception-safe.

* Added a templated factory for non-intrusive serialization of external
  inheritance hierarchies (new header file "geners/AbsReaderWriter.hh").

* Added "gs_associate_serialization_factory" macro in the new header file
  "geners/associate_serialization_factory.hh".

* Added example code "serializing_external_templates.cc" illustrating
  serialization of external inheritance hierarchies.


Version 1.6.0 - Apr 04 2015, by I. Volobouev

* Better handling of regex compilation error messages for POSIX extended
  regex matching (these are not used by compilers with C++11 support).

* Added "gs_enable_pseudo_io" macro in the new "geners/pseudoIO.hh" header
  file. This macro is needed in order to use classes which do not need I/O
  inside templates which expect I/O-enabled template parameters.


Version 1.5.1 - Jan 13 2015, by I. Volobouev

* More careful handling of "assert" statements so that the code compiles
  correctly and without warnings with the -DNDEBUG switch.


Version 1.5.0 - Oct 08 2014, by I. Volobouev

* Added a code generator for boilerplate template serialization.

* Added "BooleanString" template.

* Fixes for MS C++ compiler.

* Added an example illustrating how to serialize external templates.


Version 1.4.1 - Jul 17 2014, by I. Volobouev

* More clang fixes.


Version 1.4.0 - May 02 2014, by I. Volobouev

* A few fixes to quell the complaints from the clang compiler. If your
  compiler is happy with 1.3.0, you do not have to upgrade to this version.


Version 1.3.0 - June 14 2013, by I. Volobouev

* Added new "Record" and "Reference" signatures for use with strings
  in addition to char pointers.

* Added convenience functions for string archive I/O.

* Added "gssaDump" executable to the "tools" directory.


Version 1.2.0 - November 3 2012, by I. Volobouev

* Added "copyItem" method to the AbsArchive class.


Version 1.1.2 - September 5 2012, by I. Volobouev

* Added the header "CPP11_config_disable.hh" useful in case C++11
  features have to be explicitly disabled.


Version 1.1.1 - July 30 2012, by I. Volobouev

* Introduced a separate switch for the zlib location into configure.ac
  and various Makefiles.


Version 1.1.0 - July 26 2012, by I. Volobouev

* Catalog version numbers upped to 2. They now write the number
  of items stored before the entries. This allows for reading them
  without reaching the end-of-file, so that they can now be saved
  to a normal data stream. This means, in particular, that the
  StringArchive class can now be stored in other archives.

* Catalog reading code now removes the "eof" condition from
  the stream. This allows for a normal reuse of the stream later.

* Added "CompressedIO.hh" header for casual compression use.


Version 1.0.2 - June 4 2012, by I. Volobouev

* Added '#include "geners/GenericIO.hh"' statement to the ArchiveRecord.hh
  header because it is using the "write_item" function.

* Added '#include "geners/binaryIO.hh"' statement to the ArrayAdaptor.hh
  header.


Version 1.0.1 - April 5 2012, by I. Volobouev

* Added "#include <cstring>" statements to several files in which
  explicit inclusion is necessary. They were missed before due to
  automatic inclusion of <cstring> in some other system headers.
  The automatic inclusion changes from one compiler version to another.
