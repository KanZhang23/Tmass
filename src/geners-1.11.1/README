This is the README file for the Geners package. The main purpose of
this package is serialization and deserialization of C++ objects to/from
binary archives, with compression and random access to stored data.

The INSTALL file describes a typical installation procedure for the
package. Some minimal package documentation can be found in the "doc"
directory (open file "index.html" in your web browser). The code in
the "examples" directory illustrates typical package use in considerable
detail.
