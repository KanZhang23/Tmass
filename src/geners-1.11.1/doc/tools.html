<h2 style="text-align: center;">Geners Tools</h2>
The "tools" subdirectory of the "geners" package includes several
programs which can be used to examine the contents of object archives
and catalogs. By default, these programs are compiled during the normal
package installation procedure but they are not installed in any other
location on your computer. If invoked without any arguments, each
program prints its usage instructions to the standard output.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">cdump</span>
&mdash; "Catalog dump". This program can be used to print catalog contents
to the standard output and to collect item type summaries.<br>
<br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">gssa_dump</span>
&mdash; "Catalog dump for .gssa or .gssaz files". This program can be used 
to print catalogs of string archives saved in dedicated binary files. The convention
here is to use extension .gssa (Generic Serialization String Archive) for such
files without compression and .gssaz with compression.<br>
<br style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">cmerge</span>
&mdash; "Catalog merge". This program can be used to merge contents of
multiple catalogs. The resulting catalog can be treated as a single
combined "geners" archive. Object data files included as members of the
new combined archive do not have to be modified.<br>
<br style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">gssa_merge</span>
&mdash; "String archive merge". This program can be used to merge contents of
multiple .gssa or .gssaz files into a single archive.<br>
<br style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">crecover</span>
&mdash; "Catalog recover". This program can be used to recover catalog data
from binary archive data files if a copy of the catalog was merged into
the data stream. This mode of archive operation is useful mainly in the
code development process, so that the catalog can be recovered in case
of an unexpected program crash.<br>
<br style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">print_items</span>
&mdash; This program can be used to fetch items from an archive and to print
them to the standard output. It is expected that this particular
program will be extended by the users as they develop their own classes
(see comments at the beginning of file "print_items.cc"). In its
original form, the program can only print C++ strings and built-in
numeric types.<br>
<br style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">template_io_boilerplate</span>
&mdash; This program generates a boilerplate header file for serializing
templates that can not be modified by the user (<i>i.e.</i>, coming from an external library).<br>
