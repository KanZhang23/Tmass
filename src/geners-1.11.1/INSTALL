This package needs compression libraries libz.so and libbz2.so. These
libraries are installed by default on many Linux distributions. Make
sure that you have these libraries on your system together with
corresponding header files "zlib.h" and "bzlib.h".

If you want to enable the C++11 support in the package, you have to do
it explicitly. If g++ is your compiler of choice, it is sufficient to
define the "CXXFLAGS" environmental variable which includes the switch
"-std=c++0x". Naturally, g++ version must be recent -- the package is
known to compile with g++ 4.8.3, but slightly earlier versions might
work as well. For other compilers with good C++11 support, copy the
file "geners/CPP11_config_enable.hh" into "geners/CPP11_config.hh".

If you instead want to make sure that C++11 features are disabled (for
compatibility with an existing library or some other such reason), copy
the file "geners/CPP11_config_disable.hh" into "geners/CPP11_config.hh".

After this, a typical installation of the "geners" package can proceed
as follows:

./configure --with-pic
make
make install

The last step may have to be performed as root. Run

./configure --help

to view available configuration options. For example, if you do not
have libbz2.so and bzlib.h in standard system locations, you may have
to explicitly tell the "configure" script where to find these files
using corresponding switches.

It is also recommended to run "make check" before running "make
install".  Various example and helper programs will run. Near the
end of the printouts, you should see something like

============================================================================
# TOTAL: 7
# PASS:  7
# SKIP:  0
# XFAIL: 0
# FAIL:  0
# XPASS: 0
# ERROR: 0
============================================================================

If you do not see this output, something went wrong with your package
configuration or code compilation process.
