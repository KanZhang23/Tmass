Usage: cdump [-a] [-c] [-f] [-i] [-s] filename

This program prints the contents of "geners" catalog files to the standard
output. These files can be usually recognized by their ".gsbmf" extension
(Generic Serialization Binary MetaFile). Normally, the program prints class
names, item names in the archive, and archive categories for all items in
the catalog. This default behavior can be modified with option switches.
The meaning of the switches is as follows:

 -a   Print catalog annotations, if any.

 -c   Print default archive compression mode.

 -f   Full dump. Print complete info for each catalog entry.

 -i   Include the catalog item ids into the printout.

 -s   Print only the summary statistics for item types. If option "-f" is given
      together with "-s", the summary will be printed after the full dump.

PASS cdump (exit status: 0)
