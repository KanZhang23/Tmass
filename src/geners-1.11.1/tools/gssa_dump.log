Usage: gssa_dump [-f] [-s] filename

This program prints the contents of "geners" string archives to the standard
output. Files which contain string archive can be usually recognised by their
extensions ".gssa" (Generic Serialization String Archive) and ".gssaz"
(string archive with compression). Normally, the program prints item ids,
class names, item names, and archive categories for all items in the archive.
This default behavior can be modified with option switches. The meaning of
the switches is as follows:

 -f   Full dump. Print complete info for each catalog entry.

 -s   Print only the summary statistics for item types. If option "-f" is given
      together with "-s", the summary will be printed after the full dump.

PASS gssa_dump (exit status: 0)
