Usage: crecover archive_name [annotation]

This program recovers the "geners" catalog data from binary archives.
The recovery is possible only if the archive mode string included the
"cat=i" section which instructs the binary archive to write a duplicate
copy of item metadata into the data stream. This mode of operation
is recommended in the development stage of your project, so that the
catalog can be recovered even after an unexpected program crash.

The first command line argument is the name of the "geners" archive
without extension or data file number. The second argument is optional.
If provided, it will become the annotation string added to the recovered
catalog.

PASS crecover (exit status: 0)
