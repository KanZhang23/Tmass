The abstract class AbsUncertaintyCalculator helps computing the numerical
integration of high dimensional integrals over [0,1)^d with estimates
on the error bounds. The main two methods used are Pseudo Monte Carlo and
Quasi-Monte Carlo (only digital nets).
Pseudo Monte Carlo uses the regular Central Limit Theorem bound while
Quasi Monte has a more technical analysis based on the Walsh-Fourier
coefficients of the integrand (assumed to be absolutely convergent).
The guarantee is based on the decay rate of these coefficients.
