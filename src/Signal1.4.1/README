This is a slighly modified Tcl "Signal" package (author: Michael Schwartz).
See the file "sig.announce.1.4" for a description. The only change from
the original is the addition of the "waitpid" and "getppid" commands,
as well as repackaging according to the TEA (tcl extensions architecture)
conventions.

The "waitpid" command should be used as follows:

waitpid pid_number

where pid_number is an integer. The command simply returns the result
of the waitpid(pid_number, NULL, WNOHANG) system call. Run "man 2 waitpid"
for the details. The "getppid" command (which has no arguments) returns
the result of the getppid() system call.


Simple Installation
-------------------

./configure --prefix=/whatever/your/tcl/installation/prefix/was
make
make install

If this does not work, try "./configure --help" to see which additional
options are available.
