Change directory to this one and run the tests as follows:

tclsh all.tcl

The functions will sometimes print out error messages to the standard error,
for example

hs_create_ntuple: Error. Specified title string is too long, truncating
     ->blah blah blah (long title repeated).

This is normal and expected. Don't pay attention to these messages, rather,
make sure that the system passes all the tests.
