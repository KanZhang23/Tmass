Change directory to this one and run the tests as follows:

wish all.tcl

The tests in this directory require user interaction. The GUI tools
built into the hs extension will pop up sequentially, as soon as
the user dismisses the previous GUI (do not exit the main Histo-Scope
GUI though). The purpose of the tester is to crash the GUIs :-)
