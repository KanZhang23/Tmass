bighisto.hs.gz, bighisto.root -- these files contain the same 2d histogram
in gzipped Histo-Scope format and in ROOT format. This histogram has 140x896
bins. It is a typical calibration pulse height distribution from a CDF silicon
ladder. Compare the performance of Histo-Scope and ROOT in displaying and
manipulating this histogram (zooming, rotation, etc). In our experience,
Histo-Scope is about two orders of magnitude faster.
