This directory contains example scripts which illustrate the use of "hs"
tcl extension. The files with extension .tcl should be sourced into
a running wish. The following files should be present in this directory:

2d_histos.tcl       | This example illustrates different options for
                    | drawing two-dimensional histograms.
                    |
3d_histo.tcl        | This example shows how to create and slice
                    | a three-dimensional histogram
                    |
comments.tcl        | Some examples of comments and labels using different
                    | fonts.
                    |
ellipses.tcl        | An example which draws a bunch of colored ellipses.
                    |
epsf.tcl            | An example which imports a plot into itself several
                    | times using EPS format.
                    |
example_utils.tcl   | Various utility procedures used by other scripts.
                    |
fft_aliasing.tcl    | This example demostrates some FFT aliasing effects.
                    | It can be easily adapted to plot Fourier transforms
                    | of various functions.
                    |
fft_basis.tcl       | This example shows the time and frequency domain
                    | representations of basis functions (single-bin peaks).
                    |
fft_example.tcl     | Example which illustrates the usage of FFT-related
                    | commands. The hs extension has to be compiled with
                    | CERNLIB for this example to work properly.
                    |
fill_styles.tcl     | This example illustrates 1d histogram fill styles
                    | available in Histo-Scope.
                    |
first.tcl           | A simple example which shows how to load the extension,
                    | make a histogram, and display it.
                    |
fit_example_0.tcl   | A very simple fitting example which sets up a fit
                    | and starts the fit tuner GUI.
                    |
fit_example_1.tcl   | More complicated fitting example which sets up
                    | a simultaneous fit of 4 datasets and starts the fit
                    | tuner GUI.
                    |
fit_example_2.tcl   | Example of an unbinned maximum likelihood fit.
                    |
fit_example_3.tcl   | This example fits 2d Gaussian mixture with a sum of
                    | 2d template histograms.
                    |
gui_tools.tcl       | This example illustrates the GUI tools built into
                    | the hs extension: histogram browser, function browser,
                    | histogram slicer, and fit tuner.
                    |
hscompare           | This stand-alone script can be used to compare
                    | histograms stored in two or more Histo-Scope files.
                    | The code finds identically binned histograms with
                    | the same titles, figures out how different they are
                    | in several different norms, and displays a GUI
                    | which allows easy histogram sorting by the magnitude
                    | of their dissimilarity. Needs the BLT extension.
                    |
hs_example.tcl      | An example which illustrates creation of 1d histograms,
                    | 2d histograms, ntuples, and plot animation.
                    |
hswish              | A simple stand-alone script which allows you to load
                    | and use several Histo-Scope whose names are provided
                    | on the command line. Needs the rdl extension.
                    |
kernel_1d.tcl       | This script illustrates one-dimensional kernel density
                    | reconstruction.
                    |
latex_colors.tcl    | The 68 standard colors known to dvips.
                    |
latex.tcl           | This example illustrates creation of comments in LaTeX.
                    |
line_styles.tcl     | This example illustrates 1d histogram line styles.
                    |
marker_styles.tcl   | This script illustrates marker styles available for
                    | ntuple plots.
                    |
overlays.tcl        | This example illustrates various types of ntuple
                    | plots and shows how to display several curves in one
                    | window.
                    |
README              | This file.
                    |
triangle.tcl        | This example illustrates how different coordinate 
                    | systems can be used in the single object drawing.
