"hs" extension wish list
------------------------

1) Include "weighted_column_percentiles" command.

2) Include "column_sum" command.

3) Write a wrapper for the hs::allow_item_send command so that the state
   can be returned to the user.

4) Change data_1d and data_2d functions so that they interpolate without
   modifying the histogram integral (fix edges).

5) Add data_3d function.

6) Include "partial_integral" command for histograms -- integral between
   given values of xmin (ymin, zmin) and xmax (ymax, zmax).
