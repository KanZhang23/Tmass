Before installing this package, make sure that tcl, tk, Histo-Scope,
LAPACK, and BLAS have already been installed on your system.

Installation Steps
------------------

1. Edit the Makefile. You only need to change a few definitions at the
   top of the Makefile: HISTO_LIB_DIR, TCL_CONFIG_FILE, TCL_INCLUDE_DIR
   and, possibly, CC, FC, and FLIBS. You may have to do more extensive
   editing if you are not on a Linux box.

2. Type "make".

3. Type "make install". This step may require superuser privileges.

4. Start "wish" and type "source examples/hs_example.tcl" in it.
   If the installation was successful then this script will display
   a bunch of histograms on your screen.

5. Optionally, run tests by typing "make test".
