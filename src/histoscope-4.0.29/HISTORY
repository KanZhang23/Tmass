April 2015:      Server socket now binds to INADDR_LOOPBACK instead
                 of INADDR_ANY. This makes it compliant with Fermilab
                 computer security guidelines. Forward the port via
                 ssh if you want to connect a remote client.

September 2012:  Conversion of the build system to autotools by igv.
                 Fortran bindings and HBOOK I/O are disabled as obsolete.

2006:            Ported to 64-bit platforms by igv.

October 2002:    Numerous modifications by igv. Added color plots, extended
                 communication abilities, fixed a set of bugs, etc.
