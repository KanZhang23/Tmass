This package contains a "lean" version of Histo-Scope. It no longer
supports Fortran bindings or HBOOK I/O.

In order to compile Histo-Scope, you will need to install the Motif
programming toolkit first. Most Linux distributions come with OpenMotif
packages. You will need both the Motif library and the header files.

After Motif is installed, a typical installation of the "Histo-Scope"
package can proceed as follows:

./configure --with-pic
make
make install

The last step may have to be performed as root. Run

./configure --help

to view available configuration options. In particular, if you install
Motif into some unusual directory (e.g., a subdirectory of your home
directory), you will need to supply configuration options
--with-motif-include-path and --with-motif-lib-path.

The build procedure will generate the three main Histo-Scope executables
("histo", "hsdir", and "nplot") as well as the C API library libCHisto.so
(and/or libCHisto.a). Executables, library, and the C API header files
("histoscope.h", "hsTypes.h", and "hsFile.h") will be installed according
to the "configure" options.
