Figure 21.  Ntuple Window<p>
<p>
Whenever an Ntuple is selected from the Main Window, an Ntuple window pops up
that allows you to specify the variables to plot and the type of plot desired.
The name of the Ntuple appears as the window title so that you can readily
identify the Ntuple Window of one data item from another. <p>
<p>
First, select the type of plot you want from the <i>Plot Type</i> pull-down
menu:<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig20.gif"><p>
<p>
Figure 22.  Plot Type Pull-Down Menu<p>
<p>

Then, select variables from the <i>Variables</i> list box at left and assign
the selected variable to the desired plot position by pressing the
corresponding <i>Assign</i> push-button.  Double clicking on a variable name
will assign the variable to the next vacant assignment position.  To de-assign
a variable, click on "&lt;Clear Entry&gt;" and then click on the assignment
position you'd like to clear.  How each variable is used in the plot depends on
the plot type and the assignment position:<p>
<p><pre>
      Prefix	 Use<p>
	V	Variable<p>
	X	Variable plotted against X axis<p>
	Y	Variable plotted against Y axis<p>
	Z	Variable plotted against Z axis<p>
	S	Variable not plotted, but used as a slider variable to see <p>
	          "cuts" of data<p>
	E+	Variable used as error values (+) for preceeding variable<p>
	E-	Variable used as error values (-) for preceeding variable<p>
	V+	Variable used as vertical error values (+) for preceeding<p> 
	          variable (XY Plot only)<p>
	V-	Variable used as vertical error values (-) for preceeding <p>
	          variable (XY Plot only)<p>
	H+	Variable used as horizontal error values (+) for preceeding<p>
	          variable (XY Plot only)<p>
	H-	Variable used as horizontal error values (-) for preceeding <p>
	          variable (XY Plot only)<p>
<p>
<p></pre>
Up to seventeen variables can be assigned for certain plot types.  To expose
additional plot assignments, drag the bottom frame of the Ntuple window
downward with the mouse.  The window will grow downward as you pull.<p>
<a name="a">
<p>
If only positive </a>(+) errors are specified for a variable, Histo-Scope will display
those error values as symmetric (+ and -) errors.<p>
<p>
In addition to the variables that are part of the Ntuple, you can use the <i>Create
Variable</i> button to derive additional variables and constants for plotting.  This will pop up a
window that allows you to enter the information for the created variable (see below). 
Once you have created a variable, selecting it in the Variables list and pressing
<i>Modify Variable</i> will pop up a window for making changes.<p>
<p>
When all the settings in the window are to your liking, press the <i>Plot
</i>button for the chosen plot or histogram to be displayed.<p>
<p>
Many plots can be requested from the same Ntuple Window.  To request another
plot, select the Ntuple window and repeat the above procedure.<p>
<p><a name="1a">
The <i>Dismiss</i> </a>button will dismiss only the Ntuple window.  Plots and
histograms currently displayed will remain open until explicitly closed or
until Histo-Scope exits.<p>
<p>

Use the <i>Create Variable</i> button to derive additional variables and constants for
plotting.   This will pop up a window that allows you to enter the name and expression 
for the created variable. <p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig23b.gif"><p>
<p>
Figure 23. XY Scatter Plot<p>
<p>
To create a derived variable, fill in the Variable Name and Expression fields in this 
dialog and press <i>Create</i>.<p>
<p>
The variable name can be any arbitrary character string, although strings without spaces
or punctuation are easier to use in expressions.<p>
<p>
The expression should be a Fortran or C style arithmetic expression.  Valid operators are:
+, -, /, *, ^ (or **).  There are also a number of built-in single-argument functions
and constants.  These can be pasted into the expression at the current text cursor 
position by clicking on the <i>Paste Function</i> or <i>Paste Constant</i> menus and
selecting the expression or constant to insert.  Variable names can similarly be pasted
into the expression area by clicking on the <i>Paste Variable</i> menu.  When typing
variables that contain spaces or punctuation, or variables that start with a number, the
variable name should be surrounded in double quotes (").  Multi-line expressions with
temporary variable assignments are also allowed, for example: <p>
<pre>
     a = sqrt(X) + 2*Y
     b = Z**2 / (4*X)
     a**2 +b*a**3
     
 </pre>
 The value of the last line of the expression is taken as the value of the created
 variable.<p>
 <p>
 Once the variable is created, it can be modified or deleted using the same window.  
 If you dismiss the window oe lose it under other windows on your screen, you can pop 
 it up againby selecting the variable in the Ntuple Window and pressing <i>Modify Variable </i>.
 <p>
<h2>
<a name="1">Time Series Plots
</a></h2>
<p>
A Time Series plot will plot the value of a variable from your Ntuple in the
sequence in which that variable was collected.  Thus, the x-axis values start
at zero and increase to the number of occurrences in the Ntuple.  The value of
the Ntuple variable is plotted along the y-axis of the plot.<p>
<p>
Up to eighteen variables can be plotted in one window.  To reveal additional
assignment buttons, use the mouse to grab the bottom frame of the Ntuple Window
and pull downward.  The window will grow as you move the mouse pointer
downward.  <p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig21.gif"><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Figure 24. Time Series Plot<p>
If only one variable is plotted, its name appears at the top of the y-axis.  If
more than one variable is plotted, a legend of variable names appears at the
bottom of the plot.<p>
<p>
Initially, the entire range of the plot is displayed.  You can change the size
of the plot by changing the size of its window (by dragging on the window
frame).  You can change the scale of the plot by using the mouse to drag a part
of an axis (just outside of the plot) toward one direction or another.  Use a
point near the upper half of the axis to change the maximum axis value.  Use an
axis point near the lower half of the axis to change the minimum axis value.
This will zoom in or out, depending on the direction you drag that axis
point.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig22.gif"><p>
Figure 25. Interacting with Time Series Plots<p>
<p>
Once you have scaled a plot, it is possible to grab a point inside the plot and
pan the plot, moving it around inside the axes. <p>
<p>
Histo-Scope allows Time Series plots to be overlaid by other one-dimensional
plots such as 1-D histograms, adaptive 1-D histograms, XY Plots, and other 
Time Series Plots.  Up to ten plots can be overlaid in one window.  To insert 
a plot on top of a Time Series plot, use the middle mouse button to drag a plot 
onto the Time Series plot window  (To drag the plot, press the middle mouse 
button while the pointer is over the plot area of the desired plot, and, while 
holding the mouse button down, move the mouse pointer over to the receiving 
time series plot, and then release the middle mouse button.  When you press the 
middle mouse button, the pointer changes to indicate that your are initiating a 
drag.)  If the drag succeeds, you will see both plots overlaid in the receiving 
window (the source plot remains unchanged).  If the drag does not succeed, you 
will see the drag icon move back to the source plot when you release the middle 
mouse button.  <p>
<p>
You can use the <u>right</u> mouse button on a selected plot window to pop-up a
menu which allows the following functions:<p>

<h2>
<a name="2">XY Plot
</a></h2>
<p>
An XY Plot plots pairs of points in two dimensions.  The points are taken in
sequence from the Ntuple and are initially drawn with lines connecting the
points and no markers.  The XY Plot can also be used as an alternative to the
Scatter Plot.  In this case, use the Set Mark and Line Style plot adjustment to
turn on markers and turn off connecting lines.  (When the number of points is
small, the marks drawn by the XY Plot are much more visible than the
pixel-sized dots drawn by the Scatter Plot.)  The XY Plot can also plot
multiple sets of variable X-Y pairs from the Ntuple, distinguish them with
different marker styles, and draw both horizontal and vertical error bars.  Up
to nine X-Y pairs can be plotted in one window.  To reveal additional
assignment buttons, use the mouse to grab the bottom frame of the Ntuple Window
and pull downward.  The window will grow as you move the mouse pointer
downward. <p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig23.gif"><p>
<p>
Figure 26. Sorted XY Plot<p>
<p>
Since the points in an XY Plot are not sorted the initial appearance of the
plot may include lines which loop back on themselves.  Another type of XY Plot
is the <b>Sorted XY Plot</b>.  In a Sorted XY Plot, the x-axis variable is
sorted in order of increasing value and each succeeding variable is plotted
along the y-axis against the first (sorted) variable.  This can often be a
better way to observe how y varies with x.  A Sorted XY Plot can display up to
seventeen Y-variables in one window.  If only one Y-variable is plotted, its
name appears at the top of the y-axis.  If more than one is plotted, a legend
of variable names appears at the bottom of the plot.<p>
<p>
Both types of XY Plots allow you to specify variables as error values.  An XY
Plot w/Errors can plot up to three X-Y pairs with their corresponding vertical
and horizontal errors.  A Sorted XY Plot w/Errors can plot up to five
Y-variables and their corresponding (vertical) errors.  (To expose hidden plot
variable assignments, drag the bottom frame of the Ntuple window downward with
the mouse.  The window will grow downward as you pull.)<p>
<p>
Initially, the entire range of the plot is displayed.  You can change the size
of the plot by changing the size of its window (by dragging on the window
frame).  You can change the scale of the plot by using the mouse to drag a part
of an axis (just outside of the plot) toward one direction or another.  Use a
point near the upper half of the axis to change the maximum axis value.  Use an
axis point near the lower half of the axis to change the minimum axis value.
This will zoom in or out, depending on the direction you drag that axis
point.<p>
<p>

<p>
Once you have scaled a plot, it is possible to grab a point inside the plot and
pan the plot, moving it around inside the axes. <p>
<p>
Histo-Scope allows XY plots to be overlaid by other one-dimensional plots such 
as 1-D histograms, 1-D adaptive histograms, Time Series Plots, and other XY
plots.  Up to ten plots can be overlaid in one window.  To insert a plot on 
top of an XY plot, use the middle mouse button to drag another plot onto the XY
plot window  (To drag the plot, press the middle mouse button while the pointer
is over the plot area of the desired plot, and, while holding the mouse button
down, move the mouse pointer over to the receiving XY plot, and then release
the middle mouse button.  When you press the middle mouse button, the pointer
changes to indicate that your are initiating a drag.)  If the drag succeeds,
you will see both plots overlaid in the receiving window (the source plot
remains unchanged).  If the drag does not succeed, you will see the drag icon
move back to the source plot when you release the middle mouse button.  <p>

Figure 32. Adaptive Histogram<p>
<p>
A 1-dimensional histogram is a plot of one variable over a pre-specified range
divided into a number of bins.  An adaptive histogram is a histogram whose
bins, rather than being spaced evenly, are partitioned according to the density
of the data.  A threshold value determines the number of fills at which a
single bin is divided into additional bins.  Thus, the resolution of an
adaptive histogram is highest where the data is densest, and lowest where the
data is sparse.  <p>
<p>
Histo-Scope provides two adaptive histogram binning strategies: <i>Split in
Half</i>, and <i>Center of Gravity</i>.  The split in half strategy simply
divides the bins into two equal parts when the threshold number of fills is
reached.  The center of gravity strategy starts with the whole data set and
begins splitting the bins at their median value until the bins all contain less
than the threshold number of fills.  (Because there is also a limit on the
number of splits (20), bins can actually have more than the threshold number of
fills, but these bins will already be imperceptibly narrow except at very high
magnifications.)  <p>
<p>
Initially, the entire range (excluding overflows) of a histogram is displayed.
You can change the size of the plot by changing the size of its window.  Just
drag on the window frame to make the window the size you desire.<p>

than the threshold number of fills.  (Because there is also a limit on the
number of splits (20), bins can actually have more than the threshold number of
fills, but these bins will already be imperceptibly narrow except at very high
magnifications)  <p>

You can change the size of the plot by changing the size of its window.  Just
drag on the window frame to make the window the size you desire.  <p>
<p>
You can change the scale of the plot by using the mouse to drag a part of an
axis (just outside of the plot) toward one direction or another.  Use a point
near the upper half of the axis to change the maximum axis value.  Use a point
near the lower half of the axis to change the minimum axis value.   This will
zoom in or out, depending on the direction you drag that axis point.  <p>
<p>
Once you have scaled the plot on an axis, it is possible to grab a point just
inside of the axis and pan the plot so that it moves along the axis.  <p>
<p>
The orientation of the histogram can be changed by grabbing a part of the
display (away from an axis) with the mouse and moving the display in space to a
different orientation.  <p>

A two-dimensional cell plot is a flat representation of a two-dimensional
histogram, with bin contents represented by the size of a shaded rectangle
drawn on the center of the bin.  If the source of the data is an n-tuple,
additional variables can be selected for animation sliders.<p>

Initially, the entire range of the data is displayed.  You can change the size
of the plot by changing the size of its window.  Just drag on the window frame

A Normalization Slider can be selected from the Plot Settings menu which will
adjust the cell size in relation to the bin value of the cell.  See the section
<A HREF="histo_set.html"> <b>Adjusting Plot Settings</b></A> in this guide for a detailed explanation of the
Normalization Slider and each of the other plot settings.</a></a><p>
