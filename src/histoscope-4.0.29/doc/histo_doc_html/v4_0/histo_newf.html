New Features for Histo-Scope V4.0<a name="bk1"><br>
</h1>
<p>
<p>
The most significant new features in Histo-Scope V4.0 are:<p>
<pre>
o   New "View Overlaid" button in main panel - allows you to choose plots 
    and display them in ONE plot window, overlaid on top of each other.  
    Some plot settings now refer only to the first or "base" plot.<p>
    <p>
o   New "View Multiple" button in main panel - allows you to choose plots 
    to be displayed in single multi-plot window.<p>
    <p>
o   Multiple selection of plots in main panel list box.  Now you can select 
    more than one plot in the list box of the main panel.  To do this, use 
    the Ctrl and Shift keys in addition to the first mouse button.  You can 
    also hold the mouse button down and select contiguous items in the list 
    by dragging while holding the button down.<p>
    <p>
o   You can now re-title your plot window by selecting the "Change Window 
    Title" plot setting from the plot settings menu (the menu that pops 
    up when you press the right mouse button when pointing to a plot).<p>
    <p>
o   You can now specify in the histo command that you want to connect to a
    client.  Use the -clientid option followed by the string you put in 
    the HS_INITIALIZE call, and if necessary use the -rhost and -ruser 
    options to specify the remote host and remote username (just as you 
    would in the Connect to Client dialog).  These options can be used 
    with the -config option which specifies the configuration file to use.<p>
    <p>
o   Drag & Drop has been extended.  In V3.1.1 you used Drag & Drop to drag 
    plots into empty multi-plot window frames.  Now, in addition, you can 
    drag (2D) plots on top of other plots to overlay them.  To undo this 
    action (if this wasn't what you wanted to do), there's a new plot 
    setting:  Remove Overlaid Plot.<p>
    <p>
o   Histograms can now have various fill patterns.  To specify these, 
    select "Set Histogram Style" from the plot settings menu.<p>
      <p>
o   Histograms can now be plotted as a marker with/without error bars.  
    To do this, choose the "Set Histogram Style" option from the plot 
    settings menu and click on the linestyle option menu.  At the bottom 
    of the list of linestyles you will find marker types you can select.<p>
      <p>
o   Many 2D plots now allow colors to be specified for linestyles and 
    markers: XY Plots, Time-Series, Histograms, Adaptive Histograms, 
    Sorted XY Plots.<p>
      <p>
o   You can now ask the Histo-Scope main panel to display the data type of 
    the items in the list box.  There is a new toggle button for this at 
    the bottom of the panel.<p>
      <p>
o   There are new callable routines in the client library:<p>
   <p>
     hs_histo_with_config - starts histoscope, tells it to read a config file<p>
     hs_num_connected_scopes - returns the number of connected scopes<p>
     hs_load_config_string - causes all connected scopes to load config commands<p>
     hs_load_config_file - causes all connected scopes to load a config file<p>
     hs_create_group - create a group<p>
     hs_delete_items - delete a list of items (better browser performance)<p>
     hs_kill_histoscope - allows you to kill a histoscope you started.<p>
         <p>
o   A C++ Binding for the Histo-Scope API was contributed by Roque D. Oliveira<p> 
    at the University of Pennsylvania.  These files can be found in Histo-<p>
    Scope's contrib directory ($HISTO_DIR/contrib).<p>
