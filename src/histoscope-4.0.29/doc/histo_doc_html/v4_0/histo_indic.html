Indicators, Controls, and Triggers
</h2>
<p>
The combination of indicators, controls and triggers allows the user to control
the execution of his data acquisition or analysis program from Histo-Scope.
For instance, should peculiar results come out of diagnostic histograms,
certain code paths can be internally enabled or disabled, or the job gracefully
terminated.
<h2>
<br>
<a name="1">Indicator Window
</a></h2>
<p>
An indicator is a scalar value set by a process to indicate the value of a
variable or condition.  When selected for viewing from the Main Window, an
Indicator Window pops up: <p>
<p>

<p>
Figure 18.  Indicator Window<p>
<p>
The Indicator window by default shows the minimum and maximum values of the
indicator (at the far left and right), and the value of the indicator is
displayed in the middle of the window in a rectangular box.  If the indicator
has not yet been given a value, or has been reset, the words * not set * will
be displayed in the box.<p>
<p>
Use the <u>right</u> mouse button to pop up the plot settings for indicators:
<i>Help, Show Range, Automatic Update, Update,</i> and <i>Close.</i>  See the
section <A HREF="histo_set.html"> <b>Adjusting Plot Settings</b></A> in this guide for detailed explanations
of plot settings.<p>

<h2>
<a name="2">Control Window
</a><br>
</h2>
Controls allow a variable in a process to be set interactively using
Histo-Scope.  When selected for viewing from the Main Window, a Control Window
pops up: <p>
<p>

<p>
To set the value of the variable, first either type a value in the text field
in the lower right corner of the control window, or use the slider to enter the
value.  Then, press the <i>Set</i> button.  When the value is read and accepted
by the connected process, the current value (in the top right corner) and the
indicator above the slider will change to reflect the requested value.  In the
connected process, controls can be read by calling hs_read_control.  <p>
<p>
Controls displayed from files or a disconnected process cannot be set.<p>
<p>
Use the <u>right</u> mouse button to pop up the plot settings for controls:
<i>Help, Show Range, </i>and <i>Close.</i>  See the section 
<A HREF="histo_set.html"> <b>Adjusting Plot Settings</b></A> in this guide 
for detailed explanations of plot settings.<p>

<h2>
<a name="3">Trigger Window
</a><br>
</h2>
Triggers are buttons which can cause an action in a connected process.  When
selected for viewing from the Main Window, a Trigger Window pops up: <p>
<p>

<p>
Each time the button in the trigger window is pressed, a message is sent to the
process and, if the code in the process properly checks the trigger, an
associated routine or code fragment will be executed.  Until the trigger is
read by the connected process, the button will read "Pending."  If the button
is pressed several times before it is read, it will show a count of unprocessed
presses.  In the connected process, triggers can be detected by calling
hs_check_trigger.<p>
