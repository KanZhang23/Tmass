Figure 14. One-Dimensional Histogram<p>
<p>
When a one-dimensional histogram is selected from the Main Window or from the
NTuple Window, Histo-Scope will display a one-dimensional histogram plot.  A
one dimensional histogram is a plot of one variable over a pre-specified range
which has been divided into a number of bins.<p>

<p>
Initially, the entire range (excluding overflows) of the histogram is
displayed.  You can change the size of the plot by changing the size of its
window (by dragging on the window frame).  You can change the scale of the plot
by using the mouse to drag a part of an axis (just outside of the plot) toward
one direction or another.  Use a point near the upper half of the axis to
change the maximum axis value.  Use an axis point near the lower half of the
axis to change the minimum axis value.  This will zoom in or out, depending on
the direction you drag that axis point.<p>
<p>
Once you have scaled a plot, it is possible to grab a point inside the plot and
pan the plot, moving it around inside the axes. <p>
<p>
Histo-Scope allows one-dimensional histogram plots to be overlaid by other
one-dimensional plots such as 1-D histograms, adaptive 1-D histograms,XY Plots, 
and Time Series Plots.  Up to ten plots can be overlaid in one window.  
To insert a plot on top of a one-dimensional plot, use the middle mouse 
button to drag a plot onto the one-dimensional histogram window  (To drag 
the plot, press the middle mouse button while the pointer is over the plot 
area of the desired plot, and, while holding the mouse button down, move the 
mouse pointer over to the receiving histogram plot, and then release the middle 
mouse button.  When you press the middle mouse button, the pointer changes to 
indicate that your are initiating a drag.)  If the drag succeeds, you will see 
both plots overlaid in the receiving window (the source plot remains unchanged).
If the drag does not succeed, you will see the drag icon move back to the 
source plot when you release the middle mouse button <p>
<p>
You can also use the <u>right</u> mouse button to pop-up a menu which allows
the following functions:<p>

Error data </a>stored for the histogram can be displayed as error bars by selecting
<i>Error Data</i> from the plot settings menu.  If selected from the Ntuple
Window, up to three slider variables can be selected for adjusting the plot
with animation sliders.  See the section <A HREF="histo_set.html"> <b>Adjusting
Plot Settings</b></A> in this guide for detailed explanations of plot settings.
