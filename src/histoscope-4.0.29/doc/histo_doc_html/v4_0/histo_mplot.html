To create a plot window containing more than one plot, select <i>Multiple Plot
Windows</i>... from the Windows menu of the Histo-Scope Main Window.  The
Create Multiple Plot Window allows the user to select plots to appear together
in one larger window.  This is helpful for grouping plots together that are
related in some way and provides a mechanism that makes all the selected
mini-plots visible at the same time.<p>

There are two ways these multiple-plot windows can be populated with plots:<p>
<p>
1)	All the 1-D and 2-D Histograms in the current category (as listed in the
Histo-Scope Main Window) can be displayed in a single multi-plot window.  To do
this, click on the <i>Use Current Category</i> push button.  Histo-Scope will
automatically fill in the multi-plot window title and a default number of rows
and columns that will accommodate the number of histograms in the current
category.  The window title, # Rows, and # Columns can be modified by the user
as desired.<p>
<p>
2)	For more flexibility, <u>don't</u> press the <i>Use Current Category</i>
button.  Instead just type the window title and number of rows and columns for
the Multiple Plot window, and after pressing "Create Window" use the mouse to
drag the plots one-by-one into the initially empty multi-plot window.  This
method gives you the most flexibility for choosing and placing plots for
display. <p>
<p>
Click on the <i>Create Window</i> button to create the Multiple Plot window.
To insert plots of Ntuple variables into a multiple plot window, leave one or
more mini-plot "cells" empty and use the middle mouse button to drag a plot
onto the empty cell of the mini-plot.  (To drag the plot, press the middle
mouse button while the pointer is over the plot area of the desired Ntuple
plot, and, while holding the mouse button down, move the mouse pointer over to
the empty mini-plot area, and then release the middle mouse button.  When you
press the middle mouse button, the pointer changes to indicate that your are
initiating a drag.)<p>

To change the size of the individual plots in Multiple Plot windows, use Motif
window controls such as the window sides or corners to make the entire window
larger or smaller.<p>
<p>
Each mini-plot in the Multiple Plot window allows you to adjust its plot
settings in a manner similar to the individual plot windows.  To bring up a
Plot Settings menu, point to the plot with the mouse and press the right mouse
button.</a><p>
