<h1>
Part III - Histo-Scope Library Subroutines
<a name="bk14"></h1>
<p>
The second part of Histo-Scope is a library of routines which make up the 
application program interface to Histo-Scope.  Calls to these routines are 
inserted in the physics analysis or data acquisition code so that it can be 
"scoped" by the Histo-Scope process.  No restrictions are placed on the user 
analysis process except that it must call a routine to initialize the 
Histo-Scope application interface and then periodically call an update 
routine.  The user application does not need to run on a workstation and 
is not linked with any graphical user interface code. <p>
<p>
At the start of the analysis or data acquisition code, a call to the
Histo-Scope library declares this task to be a potential customer of the scope
tool, much as an engineer might provide a plug for his oscilloscope or logic
analyzer on his circuitry.  In the event loop, or wherever it would be useful
to see changes in the data, the program calls the Histo-Scope library update
routine.  Only when a scope is connected and a user is watching the evolution
of a particular histogram or indicator, will the update routine communicate
changes in the data to the scope.  Otherwise the update routine just returns.
Even while connected to a Histo-Scope process, the Histo-Scope update routine
also returns immediately if the update frequency period set by the Histo-Scope
user has not yet elapsed (initially set at three seconds, but can be changed by
the Histo-Scope user).  Thus, a programmer can feel free to call the update
routine as often as is convenient without concern for unnecessary impact to CPU
usage.  Just before exiting, the program calls a completion routine to notify
anyone watching that the program is finished and optionally allows the user(s)
to finish browsing data before the program exits.<p>
<p><a name="a">
Histo-Scope</a> can display HBOOK histograms and Ntuples, and Histo-Scope's own
type of histograms, Ntuples, indicators, controls, and triggers.  The
data-collection routines in the Histo-Scope library offer some performance
improvement and are simpler than those in HBOOK.  <u>Both types of data can be
freely intermixed</u> in a program with no danger of interference between them.
<p>
<p>
If using HBOOK data exclusively, only four calls to Histo-Scope need to be
added to your program:<p>
<p>
HS_INITIALIZE<p>
HS_HBOOK_SETUP<p>
HS_UPDATE<p>
HS_COMPLETE<p>
<p>

Histo-Scope provides both FORTRAN and C include files that define the
Histo-Scope routines for the convenience of the programmer.  The FORTRAN
include file, <b>histoscope.inc</b>, declares the function subprograms as
externals and defines their data type.  The C include file, <b>histoscope.h</b>
defines the function prototypes.<p>
<p>
Two FORTRAN libraries are supplied for linking with the Histo-Scope routines:<p>
<p>
<b>libFHisto</b>	for programs that do <b>not</b> use HBOOK<p>
<b>libFHistoHB</b>	for programs that <b>do</b> use HBOOK<p>
<p><a name="b">
libFHisto</a> does not require HBOOK to be installed on the system.<p>
<p>
Similarly, two C libraries are supplied for C language programs: libCHisto and
libCHistoHB.<p>
<p>

<a name="1">Histo-Scope Data Routines
</a><a name="bk17"></h2>
<p>
The Histo-Scope libraries discussed above also include a robust set of data
creation, collection, calculation, and manipulation routines that can be used
in addition to or instead of HBOOK.  These routines were designed to be simple
to use and efficient in execution.  Complete routine descriptions can be found
following the Example Programs.  This section presents an overview of the
Histo-Scope library capabilities.  <p>
<p>

Histo-Scope's data types are:<p>
<p>
*	1-d histograms<p>
*	2-d histograms<p>
*	Ntuples<p>
*	indicators<p>
*	controls <p>
*	triggers<p>
<p>
A <u>one dimensional histogram</u> stores a frequency distribution of one
variable over a pre-specified range: the range is divided into a specified
number of bins, and Histo-Scope keeps a weighted frequency count per bin.  This
data is then available for display as a histogram in Histo-Scope or saved to a
file for later program access or display by Histo-Scope. <a name="3a"> The
pertinent</a> calls
for one-dimensional histograms are:<p>
<p>
hs_create_1d_hist <p>
hs_fill_1d_hist <p>
hs_set_1d_errors hs_1d_hist_block_fill <p>
hs_1d_hist_num_bins <p>
hs_1d_hist_range <p>
hs_1d_hist_bin_contents <p>
hs_1d_hist_errors <p>
hs_1d_hist_overflows <p>

<p><a name="3">
A <u>two dimensional histogram</u> </a>stores a weighted frequency distribution of
two variables, where each variable has its own pre-specified range and number
of bins. This data is then available for display as a two-dimensional histogram
in Histo-Scope or saved to a file for later program access or display by
Histo-Scope.  The pertinent calls for two-dimensional histograms are:<p>
<p>
hs_create_2d_hist <p>
hs_fill_2d_hist <p>
hs_set_2d_errors <p>
hs_2d_hist_block_fill <p>
hs_2d_hist_num_bins <p>

<p>
An <u>Ntuple</u> is a two-dimensional array composed of a fixed number of named
variables times a growing number of occurrences.  The Histo-Scope tool allows
the user to specify which variables in the Ntuple to plot and the type of plot
to display.  Histo-Scope currently supports only in-memory Ntuples of real
numbers; i.e. Ntuples must fit in virtual memory in order to be stored and
displayed by Histo-Scope.  (Always keep in mind the performance limitations of
your machine when using very large Ntuples.)  Pertinent calls for Ntuples
are:<p>
<p>
hs_create_ntuple <p>
hs_fill_ntuple hs_num_entries <p>
hs_num_variables <p>
hs_variable_name  <p>
hs_variable_index  <p>
hs_ntuple_value   <p>
hs_ntuple_contents   <p>

hs_merge_entries  <p>
hs_sum_category  <p>
hs_sum_file  <p>

The combination </a>of <u>indicators, controls and triggers</u> allows the user to
control the execution of his data acquisition or analysis program from
Histo-Scope.  For instance, should peculiar results come out of diagnostic
histograms, certain code paths can be internally enabled or disabled, or the
job gracefully terminated.<p>
<p>
An <u>indicator</u> is a scalar value set by a process to indicate the value of
a variable or condition.  Indicators are set by the application program and
viewed by the user of the Histo-Scope tool.   The pertinent calls for
indicators are:<p>
<p>
hs_create_indicator <p>
hs_set_indicator <p>
<p>

<u>Controls</u> allow a variable in a process to be set interactively using
Histo-Scope.  The application creates the control and supplies a default value.
A user of the Histo-Scope tool can then view the control and change its value.
It is up to the application program to read the control and detect a new value.
 The pertinent calls for controls are:<p>
<p>
hs_create_control <p>
hs_read_control 

A <u>trigger</u> is created by the application program and acts like a
push-button the Histo-Scope user can set which, when detected by the
application program, can cause the it to perform some action.  Histo-Scope
remembers whenever a trigger is set and will buffer trigger presses.  Trigger
presses are detected by calling hs_check_trigger.  Pertinent calls for triggers
are:<p>
<p>
hs_create_trigger <p>
hs_check_trigger <p>


<u>Groups</u> are a pseudo-data type that allow an application to specify a
grouping of already-created data items.  Once data items are specified as a
group, they can be displayed all at once from the Histo-Scope Main Panel rather
than asking for each plot separately.  Groups can be displayed as a Multiple
Plot Window, an Overlaid Plot, or simply used as a convenience for putting
plots up individually with fewer mouse clicks.  One of these display types are
specified as a default when creating the group:<p>
<p>
hs_create_group 
<p>
<a name="1b">
In addition </a>to routines specific to a particular data type,  the following
routines apply to each data type above:<p>
<p>
hs_reset	-	Resets the item.  For histograms, all of the bins and overflows are
set to 0.  For Ntuples all of the data is removed.  Indicators are set to *not
set*.  Controls are set to their default value. For triggers, any pending
trigger presses are cleared. <p>
<p>
hs_delete	-	Deletes the specified item. <p>
<p>
hs_delete_items	-	Deletes a list of items. <p>
<p>
hs_delete_category	-	Deletes all items in the specified category. <p>
<p>
hs_save_file	-	Saves all current histograms, Ntuples, indicators, and controls
to a Histo-Scope-format file.  Triggers are not saved to files.<p>
 <p>
hs_save_file_items	-	Saves the specified items to a Histo-Scope-format file.<p>
 <p>
hs_read_file	-	Reads in the items from a Histo-Scope-format file.  Allows a
prefix to be added to the categories of all items read so that items from
various runs can be differentiated. <p>
<p>
hs_read_file_items	-	Selectively reads in items matching a specified category
and list of uid's from a Histo-Scope-format file.  Allows a prefix to be added
to the categories of all items read so that items from various runs can be
differentiated.<p>
<p>
hs_change_uid	-	Changes the uid of the specified item.<p>
<p>
hs_change_category	-	Changes the category of the specified item.<p>
<p>
hs_change_title	-	Changes the title of the specified item.<p>
<p>
hs_num_items	-	Returns the total number of Histo-Scope data items defined so
far.<p>
<p>
hs_id	-	Returns the histo-scope defined id from an item's uid and category
pair.<p>
<p>
hs_uid	-	Returns the user-defined id for a specified item. <p>
<p>
hs_category	-	Returns the category string and its length for an item. <p>
<p>
hs_title 	-	Returns the title of an item.<p>
<p>
hs_type 	-	Returns the data type of an item.<p>
<p>
hs_id_from_title	-	Returns the histo-scope defined id of an item from a
specified title and category. <p>
<p>
hs_list_items	-	Lists all of the item id's matching a specified category and
title.  Exact and inexact matches are allowed.</a><p>

<p>
The example programs in the next section can be found on Unix systems in:<p>
<p>
	$HISTO_DIR/examples <p>
<p>
A makefile for building the programs is also supplied.  Copy the sources and
the Makefile to your own directory to compile and link the programs.<p>
<p>
To copy, compile, and run the example programs on Unix type:<p>
<p>
%<i> setup histo</i><p>
%<i> cp $HISTO_DIR/examples/* .</i><p>
<p>
If you have the CERN software installed on your system type:<p>
<p>
%<i> setup cern</i><p>
%<i> make</i><p>
<p>
Otherwise (if you do <b>not</b> have CERN installed):<p>
<p>
%<i> make hsExample</i><p>
%<i> make HsExample</i><p>
<p>
If necessary, go to an X display and set the DISPLAY environment variable
(refer to page 7):<p>
<p>
%<i> setenv DISPLAY devicename:0</i><p>
<p>
Then run any of the example programs you'd like to see, for example:<p>
<p>
% <i>HbookExample</i><p>
<p>
The example programs automatically run Histo-Scope as a subprocess.  Removing
the HS_HISTOSCOPE call will make the program run independently of Histo-Scope.
When Histo-Scope is run as a sub-process, it is automatically connected to the
running process.  Refer to Part I on using the Histo-Scope tool.<p>
<p>
Following the example programs is a description of each routine in the
Histo-Scope library for FORTRAN and C.<p>

<a name="2a">
<u>Linking your own Histo-Scope application:</u></a><p>
<p>
Once the setup histo command has  been  invoked, all user binary object
libraries are accessible via the environment variable HISTOLIB_DIR.  Which 
library to use depends on whether your program is written  in FORTRAN or C, 
and whether or not you are using HBOOK.  Use one of the following libraries: <p>
   <p>
	libFHisto.a <p>
	libCHisto.a <p>
	libFHistoHB.a <p>
	libCHistoHB.OLB <p>


For example to link a FORTRAN user program that includes calls to the 
Histo-Scope and HBOOK libraries, use the library libFHistoHB.a.<p>
