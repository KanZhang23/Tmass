Connect to Process Window
</h2>
<p>
When you select <i>Connect to Process</i> from the Main Window's <i>File/Process</i> 
pull-down menu, Histo-Scope will pop-up a dialog box that lists all 
processes on the machine Histo-Scope was run from that it can connect to.  
That is, each running process is listed that has called the HS_INITIALIZE
routine thereby making itself known to Histo-Scope.<p>

<p>
Histo-Scope allows heterogeneous connections.  For example, you can run
Histo-Scope on an SGI Unix system and connect to a process running on a DEC
OSF-1 system.  <p>
<p>
If you want to connect to a process on another machine, enter a remote node
name and press the <i>Search Node</i> button.  The processes Histo-Scope can
connect to on that machine will then be listed after a pause for searching that
remote machine.  The .rhosts file on the remote node must allow access from
your username on the current node.  If your username is different on the remote
node than it is on your current system, you can specify a remote username, and
that user's .rhosts file will be checked for access from your current username
and system. <p>
<p>
If more than one process is listed, look for the identity string supplied in
the HS_INITIALIZE call of your program, the user-name used to start the
process, and the time the process executed the HS_INITIALIZE call (or was
started).<p>
<p><a name="2">
Pressing the <i>Connect</i> </a>button or double-clicking on a process requests
Histo-Scope to connect to the highlighted or selected process. Once the
connection is established, Histo-Scope will display on the Main Window the
top-level items and sub-categories of data items that Histo-Scope can access
from the process. <p>
<p>
When selecting <i>Connect to Process </i>from the Main Window, if you already
have a file open or are connected to another process, Histo-Scope will first
ask you if you want to close or disconnect before it pops up the Connect to
Process dialog box.<p>

If you are running Histo-Scope on a Unix system, do not put the Histo-Scope
process in the background if you plan to connect to a process.  This is because
the system may put the Histo-Scope process into a wait state that it will not
get out of until the process is put into the foreground.  After the connection
is successful, the Histo-Scope process may be put into the background, if
necessary, until you need to connect to another process.

<p>
Processes whose data can be viewed using Histo-Scope use the computer's file
system to communicate their existence to the Histo-Scope program.  The
HS_INITIALIZE call creates a small file which can be read by a Histo-Scope
program trying to  make a connection.  On Unix Histo-Scope will create and
look for running process identifications in the directory pointed to by
the TMPDIR environment variable, if defined, or the /tmp if TMPDIR is not 
defined.   However, for remote connections, Histo-Scope looks only in the
/tmp directory on the remote system.

<p>
For remote access to a running data-generating process you can verify whether
you have correctly set up your .rhosts file on that system:<p>

Type to the shell on the system you will run Histo-Scope:<p>
<p>
	% rsh <i>nodename</i> ls /tmp<p>
<p>
where <i>nodename</i> is the remote host name you will be connecting to (i.e.
where your data-generating process will be running).<p>
<p>
The following is an example .rhosts file:<p>
<p>
fnalv.fnal.gov  smith<p>
fnalo.fnal.gov  smith<p>
fnala.fnal.gov  smith<p>
fnpspf.fnal.gov  jonsmith<p>
<p>
This .rhosts file should be created on the host where your data-generating
process will run and specifies the access to this account <b>from</b> each
node/username listed above (i.e. where you expect to run Histo-Scope).  On
Unix, .rhosts resides in your home directory.<p>
<p>
After typing the above rsh command, you should see a directory of files (or a
message saying no files were found).  If an error message is printed, use this
to help correct the situation.  For instance, if the message printed is
Permission Denied, check your .rhosts file to ensure it allows access to your
username on the current host system.<p>
