<h2>
User Interface Overview for Beginning Motif Users
</h2>
<p>
Histo-Scope utilizes the OSF/Motif windowing environment.  This section gives
an overview of the graphical user interface.  For additional information, refer
to the OSF/Motif User's Guide.  Users familiar with OSF/Motif can probably skip
this section.<p>
<p>
Whenever you move the mouse, the pointer on your screen moves correspondingly.
When this guide tells you to "point to" something, it simply means move the
mouse until the pointer on your screen is positioned over the "something".  The
mouse buttons enable you to perform the following actions:<p>
<p>
* "Click" means press and release a button without moving the pointer.<p>
<p>
* "Double-click" means click a button twice in rapid succession.<p>
<p>
* "Drag" means press and hold a button while moving the pointer.<p>
<p>

<p>
Before a window can receive input from you, it must be selected as the active
window.  To select a window, point to any part of the window and click the left
(select) button on the mouse.<a href="HistoScopeV3_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a> <p>
<p>

Dragging the <b>title bar</b> of a window will move the entire window.<p>
<p>
<a name="a">
Clicking the <b>minimize button </b></a>will change the window to an icon.  (To restore 
the icon back into a window, point to the icon and double-click the select 
button.)<p>
<p>
The <b>window menu button</b> is used to display or "pull-down" the <b>window menu</b>.  
It allows the following functions:<p>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Restore</i> 	<dd>restore a window from an icon or after maximizing<p>
<dt><i>Move</i> 	<dd>change the location of the window<p>
<dt><i>Size</i> 	<dd>change the size of the window<p>
<dt><i>Minimize</i> 	<dd>shrink the window to its icon representation<p>
<dt><i>Maximize</i> 	<dd>enlarge the window to cover the entire root window<p>
<dt><i>Lower</i> 	<dd>put a window visually behind other windows on the screen<p>
<dt><i>Close</i> 	<dd>immediately stop the window and make it disappear  <p>
<p>
</dl>
You can change the size of a window by dragging the part of the window frame
that you want to alter.  For instance, dragging the bottom right corner of the
window frame downward and to the right will enlarge the window in both of those
directions.  Changing window size is useful for enlarging a histogram or plot,
increasing variable assignments in the Ntuple Window, or increasing the number
of visible items in the Main Window item list.  <p>

All Motif windows</a> contain the window controls described above.  Histo-Scope
uses the Motif <i>Application Controls</i> described below.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig2.gif"><p>
<p>
Figure 2.  Motif Application Controls Used by Histo-Scope<p>
<p>

The Histo-Scope Main window has a <b>menu bar </b>across  the top of the window
(just below the title bar). Each word in the menu bar represents a pull-down
menu, which is displayed by pulling down on the menu bar with the mouse.  To
choose a function, you can use either of the following two methods:<p>
<p>
* <i>Drag Method: </i> Point to the word for the menu you want to display, press 
and hold the select mouse button to display the menu, drag the pointer to
highlight the desired function, and then release the button.<p>
<p>
* <i>Click Method: </i> Point to the word for the menu you want to display, click 
the select button once to display the menu, point to the desired function, 
and then click again.<p>
<p>
If you decide you don't want to execute a function after the menu is displayed,
point away from the menu (so that no function is highlighted), and then release
or click the select button.<p>
<p>
Menus and their functions can also be accessed without using the mouse.
Instead, a key combination can be typed.  This is helpful when you don't want
to move your hand from the keyboard to the mouse and for experienced users
familiar with Histo-Scope's menu items.<p>
<p>
* A <i>mnemonic</i> allows you to select a menu which has one of its letters underlined.  
To select that menu, press the <i>Alt</i> <a href="HistoScopeV3_fn.html#fn3">[4]
</a> key while typing the letter that is underlined.  For example to pull down 
the <cite>F</cite><i>ile/Process</i> menu, type <i>Alt</i>  F.<p>
<p>
After pulling down the <cite>F</cite><i>ile/Process</i>  menu, you can select
one of the items in it by typing the letter that is underlined in that item.
For example, to choose <cite>O</cite><i>pen Histo-Scope File</i>, type O.<p>
<p><a name="2">
* An <i>accelerator</i></a> key for most of the menu items <i>inside</i> of a
pull-down menu is listed next to the item.  Just type that key when the window
containing that menu has keyboard focus to perform the desired function.  For
example, to <cite>O</cite><i>pen Histo-Scope File</i>, type <i>Ctrl</i> O (hold
down the control key while you type O).<p>
<p>
When a menu item cannot be selected, its name is greyed out (the name looks
very light).  Greying-out is also used for other controls (like list boxes and
pull-down menus) when they cannot be selected.  This is usually the case when
the function that the control performs does not make sense in the current
context or state of the window.<p>
<p>
<b>Pull-down menus</b> outside of the menu bar work in a similar fashion.
These menus typically appear as text outlined by a box containing a square menu
button.  When you click on the pull-down menu, the menu pops up over the box.<p>
<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig3.gif"><p>
<p>
Figure 3. A Pull-down Menu<p>
<p>
A list of items are often enclosed in a <b>list box</b>.  List boxes can be
used just for display purposes or can allow for selection of an item in a list.
Histo-Scope lists are constrained to select only one item from a list at a
time.  To select an item in the list, do one of the following:<p>
<p>
* Point to the item and click the select mouse button,<p>
* Or, use the up- and down-arrow keys to move the highlight to the item to select<p>
<p>
After selecting an item in a list, another control, a <i>push button</i>, is used 
to perform an action on the list item.  Alternatively, double-clicking an item 
will perform the default action on that item.<p>
<p><a name="3">
A <b>push button</b> </a>is a control that causes an immediate action when pressed.
To press a push button, point to it and then click the select button.  Push
buttons can direct Histo-Scope to perform a desired function or pop up another
window for your interaction with a related set of functions.  If a push button
has a dark frame outside and around it, typing &lt;Return&gt; is equivalent to
clicking the mouse to select the push button.  In addition to window-specific
push buttons such as <i>Open</i> and <i>View</i>, Histo-Scope uses standard
push button labels for the following common functions:<p>
<p>

<b>OK</b>	causes Histo-Scope to apply any changes you made in the window and
	dismiss it.<p>
<p>
<b>Apply</b>	applies any changes you made in the window without dismissing the
	window. <p>
<p>
<b>Reset</b>	cancels any changes you made to application controls in the window
	and resets their contents to the window's initial state (when it 
	was popped up).<p>
<p>
<b>Cancel</b>	closes the window without performing any changes you made since the window popped up or the Apply button was pressed.  The state of the
	window will be the same as if you hadn't changed anything.<p>
<p>
<b>Dismiss</b>	just makes the window disappear without affecting its contents
	or state.<p>
<p>
Whenever a Histo-Scope list box is too small to hold all the items that need 
to be displayed, <b>scroll bars</b> allow you to control what portion <u>is</u> displayed.  
Scroll bars usually reside at the right edge (for vertical control) or bottom 
(for horizontal control) of a box.  Each scroll bar has an arrow at each end, 
and a rectangular slider in the middle.  The slider represents the current 
(relative) position of the displayed portion of the screen and the size of the 
displayed area in relation to the total area that <u>can</u> be displayed.  
When the slider is moved, that portion of the screen represented by the 
slider is displayed.  The action of the display as it moves is called scrolling.  
There are three ways to scroll items and move the slider:<p>
<p>
* <i>Using the arrow buttons </i>- point to the arrow that points toward the direction 
you want the slider to move; press and hold the select button until Histo-Scope 
displays the portion you want to see.  This scrolls <i>line by line</i> (for the vertical
scroll bar) or by "column" (horizontal scroll bar).<p>
<p>
* <i>Using the slider</i> - grab the slider and move it where you want it.  The portion 
of the screen represented by the slider is displayed.<p>
<p>
* <i>Using the space between the slider and an arrow button</i> - click on the space
between the slider and one of the arrow buttons. The text will scroll one "page" 
in the direction of the arrow. Pressing and holding the select button will scroll 
<i>page by page</i> until you release the button.<p>
<p>

 Figure 4.  Toggle Buttons<p>
<p><a name="4">
A <b>toggle button</b> </a>is used to set and indicate a condition to be on or off.
When a toggle button appears "in" (or filled with shadow) the button is "on".
When the toggle button appears "out" (or full of light)  the button is "off".
To change the state of the toggle button, just click on it with the select
button of the mouse.  There are two kinds of toggle buttons:  A <b>radio button</b> 
is diamond shaped and is always part of a set.  Only one of the radio buttons 
in the set can be on at a time.  Choosing another radio button in the set clears 
the button that was previously on.  A regular toggle button, sometimes called a 
check button, is square shaped and is independently on or off as set by the user.
<p>
<p>
In the <i>Connect To Process</i> and <i>Scaling Variables</i> dialog boxes,<b> text areas</b> are 
provided for input and/or display of text.   To type into an input text area, 
point to it with the mouse and click<a href="HistoScopeV3_fn.html#fn4">[5]</a> the select button before typing.
The I-shaped cursor indicates the typing position.  You can use the &lt;Backspace&gt;,
&lt;Delete&gt;, and arrow keys inside text fields for editting  your input.<p>
<p>
Histo-Scope was designed to display messages to alert you to important
conditions or errors.  These messages "pop up" over the window you're currently
using and typically block you from doing anything  with Histo-Scope until you
to acknowledge the message.  To do this, just click on the appropriate push
button inside the message window.<p>
