<h2>
Adjusting Plot Settings
<a name="bk12"></h2>
<p>
Each plot window described in the previous sections allows you to pop up a menu
to change the default settings used to display the plot.  In addition, the plot
settings menu allows printing, writing a PostScript file of the plot, and
closing the plot.  To bring up the plot settings menu, make sure the plot is
selected (using the first or select mouse button) and then press the right-most
mouse button.  The plot settings menu is used  just like the other pull-down
menus throughout Histo-Scope, except that you are using the right-most button
instead of the left mouse button for selecting items in the menu.<p>

<h2>
<a name="1">Getting Help
</a></h2>
<p>
The plot settings menu for each plot includes on-line help that describes each
plot setting.<p>

<h2>
<a name="2">Getting Statistics on the Data
</a></h2>
<p>
You can get statistics on the data used in each plot type.  Each statistics
window includes the name of the data item, the number of fills (for histograms)
or entries (for Ntuples), the Sum of all the Fills (for histograms only), the
mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each variable, and overflow
sums (for histograms only). <p>

Example Statistics Window      2D Histogram Overflows<p>
</pre><p>
One-dimensional histograms have only two overflows: -X and +X.<p>

If the statistics window for a plot is displayed at the same time the user
requests a plot to be printed, the statistics are printed to the side of the 
plot (except for Multiple Plot Windows).

<h2>
<a name="3">Setting Styles for Markers and Lines and Histograms
</a></h2>
<p>
Time Series, XY, and Histogram plots allow you to place markers on the plots to
indicate the actual data points on the lines drawn in the plots.  In addition,
they allow you to set line styles for each variable in the plot.<p>
<p>
When you select Set Mark and Line Style... from the plot setting menu, one of
the following windows pop up:<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="Fig391.GIF"><p>
<p>

   <p>
<IMG SRC="Fig392.GIF"><p>
<p>
Figure 39b.  Mark &amp; Line Styles Window<p>
 
<p>
The Histograms style window contains four pull-down menus; the Mark & Line 
Styles window contains five.  The first two menu boxes are for lines, style 
and color.  When you click on the first menu box, all possible line styles 
are displayed.  Click and drag the mouse to select the line style you desire.  
As you select a new style, the line to the right of the option menu boxes 
changes accordingly so you can see what your line will look like.  In the
Histograms window, at the bottom of the lines styles options, there will be
markers displayed.  If selected the histogram will be plotted with markers 
with or without error bars depending on whether errors were previously
selected.  The second menu box allows you to select a color for the line.<p>

In the Histograms Styles window, the next two menu boxes are for histogram fill
style and color.  They work the same way as the line syle and color menu boxes 
Click and drag the mouse to select the histogram fill style and color you 
desire.  <p>

In the Mark & Line Styles Window, the second group of menu boxes allow you to 
select the marker characteristics: type, size and color.  These menu boxes work
in the usual way as well.  The variable names are listed at the top right of 
the window in both Histograms and Mark & Line Styles Windows.<p>

The six push buttons in the middle of the Mark & Lines Styles Window allow 
you to clear the marker type and line style or set the styles to a default.  
In order for these changes to take effect, press the Apply or OK button.  The 
Mark Size button pops up a window which allows you to set all markers to the 
same size.  The LineColors button pops up a window which allows you to change 
the marker colors. <p> 

To see how the plot will look with the assignments you've made, click on the 
Apply button.  The OK button will make the assignments and dismiss the window.
The Dismiss button will cancel your selection and dismiss the window.  <p>


<h2>
<a name="5">Showing/Hiding the Variables Legend
</a></h2>
<p>
By default, the variables legend in Time Series and XY plots is displayed.
To make the legend disappear, select <i>Show Variables Legend</i> from the Plot
Settings menu.  To make it reappear, select <i>Show Variables Legend</i> once
again.<p>

<h2>
<a name="6">Sliders: Observing the Effect of Other Ntuple Variables on the Plot
</a><a name="bk13"></h2>
<p>
Slider variables can be defined for many kinds of plots from Ntuple data.
Slider variables are used to study correlations among variables in the Ntuple.
They allow the user to make simple cuts in the Ntuple sample.  From the Ntuple
Window, assign these variables to the positions S1, S2, S3...  Then select
<i>Show Sliders</i> from the Plot Settings menu.  A window similar to Figure 40
will pop up.<p>
<p>
By default, each slider is set up so that all points are included and the radio
button shows that all values less than (&lt;) the value displayed are included
in the plot.  As you move the slider to the left, entries will be eliminated
that are associated in the Ntuple with values greater than the displayed value
of the slider variable.  As you move the sliders, scatter plots lose/add points
and histograms lose/add height. <p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig38.gif"><p>
<p>
Figure 40.  Animation Sliders Window<p>
<i>(shown larger than actual size)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
When the radio button for greater than (&gt;) is selected, the opposite is
true:  all values greater than the value displayed are included in the plot and
values less than are excluded.  Thus it is possible by selecting the same
Ntuple variable twice to achieve a range of values for the cut.  For example in
Figure 40, all points are displayed where the variable Y is between 4779.5 and
5245.1.  <p>
<p>
In addition to dragging the slider with the mouse, you can click on the space
to the left or right of the slider to move it in pre-defined increments.  For
smaller increment adjustments you can use the left and right arrow keys.
Typing a tab will allow you to select which slider is affected when using the
arrow keys. </a><p>

<h2>
<a name="7">Rebinning Ntuple Data Displayed as a Histogram
</a></h2>
<p>
To re-bin histograms displayed from Ntuple data, or to find out the number of
bins Histo-Scope used to display the Ntuple, select <i>Show Rebin Sliders</i>
from the Plot Settings menu.  A window similar to Figure 41 will pop up.<p>
<p>
To adjust the slider to the exact number of bins you desire, use the left and
right arrow keys.  For two-dimensional histograms with two sliders, you may
need to tab to the slider you want to change.  You can also drag the slider
with the mouse or click on the space to the left or right of the slider for
larger adjustments.<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig39.gif"><p>
<p>

<p>
To set the bin splitting threshold for adaptive histograms displayed from
Ntuple data, or to find out its current value, select <i>Show Bin Limit
Sliders</i> from the Plot Settings menu.  A window similar to the following
will pop up: <p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig40.gif"><p>
<p>
Figure 42.  Bin Limits Window<p>
<i>(shown larger than actual size)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
To adjust the slider to a new threshold value, use the left and right arrow
keys.  (Use the tab key to select the slider you want to change for
two-dimensional histograms if the slider you want to change isn't selected.)
You can also drag the slider with the mouse or click on the space to the left
or right of the slider.<p>
<p>

<h2>
<a name="8">Labelling of Histogram Bin Edges
</a></h2>
<p>
Histogram axes can optionally be numbered using the exact values of the bin
edges rather than the ordinary plot scale.  To change the labeling style,
select <i>Label at Bin Edges </i>from the Plot Settings menu.  When the bins
are very narrow, the plot reverts to the ordinary axis labeling scheme
regardless of the setting of this option. <p>

<h2>
<a name="9">Altering Cell Size for Data Displayed as a Cell Plot
</a></h2>
<p>
To alter the cell size and density of data displayed from a Cell Plot, select
<i>Show Normalization Slider</i> from the Plot Settings menu.  A window similar
to Figure 43 will pop up.  The size of a rectangle in a cell plot is
proportional to the contents of the bin it represents.  The maximum cell size
(filled in black) represents a value greater than or equal to the right
(maximum value on the Normalization Slider window.  An empty cell represents a
bin value less than or equal to the left (minimum) value on the Normalization
Slider window.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="hspict43.gif"><p>
<p>
Figure 43.  Normalization Slider<p>
<p>
Initially, the normalization slider shows the entire range of the bin values
and therefore displays the entire range of the data.  The number displayed in
the right side of the slider instructs Histo-Scope to display everything from
that value up to the maximum value to be displayed at the maximum cell size.
(Similarly, the number displayed in the left side of the slider instructs
Histo-Scope to eliminate displaying everything from that value to the minimum
value on the plot.)  The data between the two sliders is displayed with cell
size proportional (linear scaling) to the bin contents within the range of the 
normalization minimum and maximum. If the toggle-button is set to Log. Scaling
, the cell is logarithmically proportional to the bin contents within the
range.<p>
<p>
To adjust the slider drag the arrow slide you want to change with the mouse in
the direction you desire.<p>
<p>

<h2>
<a name="10">Other Views
</a></h2>
<p>
The <i>Other Views</i>  plot setting is available from two-dimensional
histogram plots and cell plots requested as another view of two-dimensional
plots.  When selecting <i>Other Views</i> from a two-dimensional histogram, a
2D Cell Plot is popped up (and vice versa).  <p>
<p>
<h2>
Show Titles 
</h2>
By default, each plot title in a Multiple Plot window is displayed.  In order
to use the entire area for the plots, the user can elect to make these titles
disappear.  To do so, select <i>Show Titles</i> from the Plot Settings menu.  To make
the titles reappear, select <i>Show Titles</i> again.
<p>
<h2>
<a name="11">Scaling and Panning the Plots
</a></h2>
<p>
There are three different ways to scale a plot after it is displayed:<p>
<p>
*	Use the mouse directly on the plot to grab the axis ticks and pull (or
stretch) the axis.  Point the mouse just to the outside of the axis using a
point near the upper half of the axis to change the maximum axis value and a
point near the lower half of the axis to change the minimum axis value.<p>
<p>
*	Use:<p>
<pre>
	Zoom In		     (Ctrl Z)<p>
	Zoom Out             (Shift Ctrl Z)<p>
	Reset View	     (Ctrl R)<p>
</pre>
from the Plot Settings menu.  <i>Zoom In</i> and <i>Zoom Out</i> will
immediately change the plot.  <i>Reset View</i> will restore the plot to its
initial orientation and scale with all its data displayed.<p>
<p>
*Use the Axis Settings window by selecting <i>Axis Settings...</i> from the
Plot Settings menu.  This menu allows you to enter values for the minimum and
maximum value of each axis.  In addition, you can change the scaling of an axis
from linear to logarithmic (and back) using the diamond-shaped radio buttons.
<p>
<p>

<h2>
</h2>
Figure 44.  Axis Settings Window<p>
<p>
All plots can be panned by grabbing a point inside the plot and dragging with
the mouse.  On 2D Histograms, you must grab a point near the axes and drag
along the axis.  
<h2>
</h2>

<h2>
<a name="12">Showing/Hiding Backplanes for 2D Histograms
</a></h2>
<p>
By default, the backplanes of 2D Histograms are displayed.  To make the
backplanes disappear, select <i>Show Backplanes</i> from the Plot Settings
menu.  To make them reappear, select <i>Show Backplanes</i> once again. <p>
<p>

<h2>
<a name="13">Showing/Hiding Errors for Histograms
</a></h2>
<p>
By default, error data in a histogram is not displayed.  If error data is
available for the plot, selecting <i>Error Data</i> from the Plot Settings menu
will show error bars using the error data from the file or process.  Selecting
<i>Error Data</i> once again, (or selecting <i>Gaussian Errors</i>) from the
Plot Settings menu will de-select Error Data.<p>
<p>
Selecting <i>Gaussian Errors</i>  from the Plot Settings menu will create error
bars for the histogram showing the square root of the bin contents.  These
errors are computed by Histo-Scope and thus do not incur communications
overhead when connected to a process.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig43.gif"><p>
<p>

<p>

<h2>
<a name="14">Thickening/Lightening Scatter Plot Points
</a></h2>
<p>
By default, the points in a scatter plot are drawn as thick points.  To make
the plot lighter, select <i>Thicken Points</i> from the Plot Settings menu to
lighten the points.  To make the points thick again, select <i>Thicken
Points</i> once again.<p>
<p>

<h2>
<a name="15">Update Options for all Plots
</a></h2>
<p>
<i>Automatic Update</i> and <i>Update</i> from the Plot Settings menu are
useful only when connected to a running process.  These two update settings
affect when data is re-displayed.  (The Main Window's Preferences menu is used
to set the <i>Update Frequency, </i>which affects how often data is requested
from the running process.)<p>
<p>
Initially <i>Automatic Update</i> mode is on (indicated by the square toggle
button to the left in the menu).  When Histo-Scope is connected to a running
process, each displayed plot with <i>Automatic Update</i> mode set on will be
updated according to the frequency set in the Preferences menu in the Main
Window (initially every 3 seconds).<p>
<p>
With <i>Automatic Update</i> off, a plot can still be individually updated with
data Histo-Scope has already received from the client by selecting
<i>Update</i> from the Plot Settings menu.<p>
<p>

<h2>
<a name="16">Printing a Plot
</a></h2>
<p>
Select <i>Print...</i> from the Plot Settings menu to print the plot.
Histo-Scope will pop up a Printer Options window for specifying the printer
queue name:  <p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="HSfig44.gif"><p>
<p>
Figure 46.  Printer Options Window<p>
<p>
The default queue names initially displayed are the environment variables
defined, if any, for lpr and flpr.  If no such defaults are available, 
the menu displays the system default queue.<p>
<p>
The last field in this dialog is the Unix command that will be used to
queue the plot for printing.  Since this command is generated from the other
options in the dialog, there is normally no reason to change it, but you can
use the field to add options and change the command in ways not otherwise
supported by the print dialog.<p>
<p>
Enter the queue name if the default queue is not the printer you would like to
use.  Press <i>Print</i> to print the file.<p>
<p>
Pressing <i>Cancel</i> will make the Printer Options window disappear without
printing anything.<p>
<p>
If the statistics window for a plot is displayed while printing a plot, the
statistics will also be printed to the side of the plot.<p>
<p>
If the plot window to be printed is a Multiple Plot window, all mini-plots 
in the window will appear on a single page similar in appearance to how they 
appear on the screen.  If titles are displayed in the Multi-Plot window, they
will also be printed.  For Multi-Plot windows, statistics are not printed.
If you find that the multiple plot window is larger than the size of the paper
you are using to print the window, try reducing the size of the Multiple Plot
window and reprinting or use a POSTSCRIPT printer that can accomodate larger 
paper.<p>
<p>
Please note that 2D Histogram plots can take some time to print because of
PostScript processing time in the printer.  As the number of bins goes up,
print processing time increases so that histograms of 100x100 bins can take
over nine minutes for the printer to process and print the file (depending on
the speed of the printer).<p>
<p>

<h2>
<a name="17">Generating a PostScript File of a Plot
</a></h2>
<p>
Select <i>Generate PostScript...</i> if you would like to save a PostScript
representation of your plot to a file.  </a>Histo-Scope will pop-up a file
selection dialog for you to enter a filename for the PostScript output.  In
Histo-Scope Version 3.0, we have encapsulated PostScript output so that this
file can be pasted into other documents.<p>

<h2>
<a name="18">Showing/Hiding the Range for Indicators and Controls
</a></h2>
<p>
By default, a slider showing the minimum and maximum values defined for an
indicator or control are displayed.  To omit these from the window, select
<i>Show Range</i> from the plot settings menu.  The filled square to the left
of the <i>Show Range</i> will disappear, indicating that showing the range is
disabled.  To enable <i>Show Range</i>, just select it once again.<p>
<p>
<h2>
<a name="19">Deleting a MiniPlot
</a></h2>
<p>
Select Delete <i>MiniPlot</i> from the Plot Settings menu to delete the mini-plot
from the Multiple Plot window.  The remainder of the Multi-Plot window is
unaffected.  After a mini-plot is deleted, it is possile to drag another
plot into that empty "cell" so that it is displayed in the Multi-Plot
window.<p>
<p>
<h2>
<a name="20"> Changing the Window Title
</a></h2>
<p>
Select <i>Change Window Title</i> from the Plot Settings menu if you
would like to change the title of the plot window  A new window will pop up
which will allow you to enter a new window title.  After you have entered a
desired new title, click on the OK button.  If you wish to cancel this
selection, there is a Cancel button to click on.
<h2>
<a name="21">Removing an Overlayed Plot
</a></h2>
<p>
Select <i>Remove Overlayed Plot </i>from the Plot Settings menu to
remove a plot which you have overlayed on another plot in the current plot
window  After you select Remove Overlayed Plot..., there will be a list of
plots that are currently overlayed in that window.  You may then drag the mouse
to select the plot you wish to remove.  <p>

<h2>
<a name="22">Closing a Plot
</a></h2>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Select <i>Close</i> from the Plot Settings menu to close the plot window
and make it disappear.  It is a good idea to close plots that are no longer
needed when connected to a process to avoid the CPU overhead of transferring
and displaying data. </a>
