<h1>
Using Histo-Scope with YBOS on VMS
</h1>
                             <p>
Histo-Scope has been tested and can be used with CDF YBOS applications.
However, <b>instead</b> of using HISTOLIB_DIR: SHR_OPTIONS_FILE.OPT in the link
command for your application, <b>use</b> the file:<p>
<p>
	<b>HISTOLIB_DIR:BCOPY_HISTO_OPT.OPT</b><p>
           <p>
Using this options file is necessary because Histo-Scope uses libraries from
the TGV MultiNet communication software package.  The MultiNet libraries
unfortunately contain a routine called bcopy which conflicts with the YBOS
routine of the same name.  Because the MultiNet library is packaged as a
shareable image, steps must be taken to ensure that the YBOS bcopy routine
takes precedence over the MultiNet bcopy routine.  BCOPY_HISTO_OPT references a
shareable image, BCOPY_SHR, which is basically the YBOS routine BCOPY linked
with the routines it references from the YBOS and CERN libraries.  The
maintainer of your system's YBOS library <u>must</u> rebuild this shareable
image whenever a new release of YBOS or CERN would make BCOPY_SHR incompatible
with that new release.<p>
<p>
BCOPY_HISTO_OPT.OPT defines a cluster for BCOPY_SHR, and then defines another
cluster for HISTO_SHR.  This will cause the linker to use BCOPY_SHR to resolve
references before using HISTO_SHR and the MultiNet library it references.  As a
general guideline, BCOPY_HISTO_OPT.OPT should be one of the last options files
referenced in your link command.  If your application itself uses clusters in
its linker options files, please note that the cluster used for HISTO_SHR
should be defined <u>after</u> all clusters defined for YBOS routines (you may
want to extract the two lines in the BCOPY_HISTO_OPT.OPT file to arrange the
cluster definitions as you require). <p>
<p>
As a final note, every time you link your YBOS application that references the
YBOS BCOPY routine, you will get a LINK warning message:<p>
<p>
     %LINK-W-MULDEF, symbol BCOPY multiply defined in module
      MULTINET_SOCKET_LIBRARY file <p>
      MULTINET_COMMON_ROOT:[MULTINET]MULTINET_SOCKET_LIBRARY.EXE<p>
                  <p>
This warning should be ignored as long as it refers to the MultiNet library
instead of the YBOS library or your own routines.<p>
