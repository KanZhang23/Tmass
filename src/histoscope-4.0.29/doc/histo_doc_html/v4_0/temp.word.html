Histo-Scope as a sub-process and displays the plots specified in the

the data generated in the user process.  The routine can either start the

<tt>Creates a group , which is an item that points to other data items,
thus grouping them into one addressable entity.  uid defines a user-specified
identification number which can later be used along with the category to
specify the item created.  category is a string defining a hierarchical
"location" for the group.  Subcategories can be specified using the "/"
character as in Unix file specifications.  If a </tt><tt>category</tt><tt> or
subcategory does not exist, it is created.  If the category argument is blank
(either " '', or ' ') the group will appear in the top level category.  The
Histo-Scope-defined id for the group is returned and is used in later calls to
identify the groups just created.  If id is .LE. 0, an error occured in
creating the group (check the arguments supplied to the function).   groupType
is the group's suggested window type.  The number of items in this group,
specified by numItems, should not be larger than 81.  itemId is an array of
Histo-Scope id numbers for the items in the group.  errsDisp is an array of
values (NO_ERROR_BARS, DATA_ERROR_BARS, GAUSSIAN_ERROR_BARS)  that corresponds
to the itemId array and tells Hist-Scope  how to display errors for the
corresponding histogram (used only when the corresponding data item is a
histogram).</tt><p>
<tt>A group can be made out of a number of items in order to display them as a
Multiple Plot Window, an Overlaid Plot, or simply as a convenience for putting
plots up individually with fewer mouse clicks.  Data items may be put into more
than one group.  Including an item in the group does not effect the display of
the item individually in the Histo-Scope main panel.  The item still appears in
the main panel list box and can be viewed individually.  The category string
can be used to affect how Histo-Scope items appear in the main panel.
</tt><p>

<tt>When a group is selected in Histo-Scope's main window and the user presses
the "View" Button, the groupType field tells Histo-Scope how to display the
items in the group.  This can be overridden in the Histo-Scope main panel by
using the "View Multiple" or "View Overlaid" buttons.  If groupType is
HS_MULTI_PLOT, pressing the View button displays all the 1- and 2D histograms
in the group as one Multi-plot window.  Similarly, if you would like to see all
the 1D histograms in a group displayed over each other in one plot window, you
can specify a groupType of HS_OVERLAY_PLOT.  Triggers, controls, and indicators
cannot appear inside a Multiple Plot Window or Overlaid Plot and so these items
in a group are displayed in their own windows.</tt><p>
<tt>Specifying HS_INDIVIDUAL for groupType means that if a group is selected,
and the "View" button is pressed on the Histo-Scope main panel, each data item
in the group will be viewed individually.  In the case of Ntuples, the Ntuple
panel will be displayed so the the user can choose the variables to plot and
the type to use.</tt><p>

<tt><i></i>Creates a group , which is an item that points to other data items,
thus grouping them into one addressable entity.  uid defines a user-specified
identification number which can later be used along with the category to
specify the item created.  category is an optional string (can be NULL or an
empty string) defining a hierarchical "location" for the group.  Subcategories
can be specified using the "/" character as in Unix file specifications.  If a
</tt><tt>category</tt><tt> or subcategory does not exist, it is created.  If
the category argument is missing (either "'', or NULL) the group will appear in
the top level category.  The Histo-Scope-defined id for the group is returned
and is used in later calls to identify the group just created.  If id is &lt;=
0, an error occured in creating the group (check the arguments supplied to the
function).   groupType is the group's suggested window type.  The number of
items in this group, specified by numItems, should not be larger than 81.
itemId is an array of Histo-Scope id numbers for the items in the group.
errsDisp is an array of values (NO_ERROR_BARS, DATA_ERROR_BARS,
GAUSSIAN_ERROR_BARS)  that corresponds to the itemId array and tells Hist-Scope
