<tt>Creates a group, which is an item that points to other data items, thus
grouping them into one addressable entity.uid defines a user-specified 
identification number which can later be used along with the category to 
specify the item created.  category is a string defining a hierarchical 
"location" for the trigger.  Subcategories can be specified using the "/" 
character as in Unix file specifications.  If a category or subcategory does not
exist, it is created.  If the category argument is blank (either " '', or ' ')
the trigger will appear in the top level category.  The Histo-Scope defined id
for the trigger is returned and is used in later calls to identify the trigger
just created.  groupType is the group's suggested window type.  The number of
items in this group, specified by numItems, should not be larger than 81.
itemId is an array of HS item ids that compose the group.  errsDisp is an 
array of values (NO_ERROR_BARS, DATA_ERROR_BARS, GAUSSIAN_ERROR_BARS) that
corresponds to the itemId array and tells Histo-Scope how to display errors
for the corresponding histogram (used only when the corresponding data item 
is a histogram).  <p>
A group can be made out of a number of items in order to display them as a
Multiple Plot Window, an Overlaid Plot, or simply as a convenience for putting
plots up individually with fewer mouse clicks.  Data items may be put into more
than one group and there is no limit on the number of groups you can create.  
Including an item in a group does not effect the display of the item
individually in the main panel.  The item still appears in the main panel list
box and can be viewed individually.  The category string can be used to affect
how Histo-Scope items appear in the main panel.<p>
When a group is selected in Histo-Scope's main window and the user presses the
"View" Button, the groupType field tells Histo-Scope how to display the items
in the group.  This can be overridden in the Histo-Scope main panel by using
the "View Multiple" or "View Overlaid" buttons.  If groupType is HS_MULTI_PLOT,
pressing the View button displays all the 1- and 2-D histograms in the group 
as one Multi-plot window.  Similarly, if you would like to see all the 1D
histograms in a group displayed over each other in one plot window, you can 
specify a groupType of HS_OVERLAY_PLOT.  Triggers, controls, and indicators
cannot appear inside a Multiple Plot Window or Overlaid Plot.<p>
Specifying HS_INDIVIDUAL for groupType means that if a group is selected, and
the "View" button is pressed on the Histo-Scope main panel, each data item in
the group will be viewed individually.  In the case of Ntuples, the Ntuple
panel will be displayed so that the user can choose the variables to plot and
the type to use.
