<a name="RTFToC1">New
Features for Histo-Scope V3.1
</a><a name="bk0"><br>
</h1>
<p>
The most significant new features in Histo-Scope V3.1 are:<p>
<p>
*	Configuration files for saving complete Histo-Scope sessions<p>
*	Windows for viewing groups of plots<p>
*	Ability to transform Ntuple variables with arbitrary arithmetic expressions<p>
*	New XY plot types<p>
*	Titles and optional statistics included on printouts<p>
<p>
Configuration files are files of Histo-Scope commands for opening windows,
scaling plots, adjusting plot appearance, and setting slider positions.
<i>Save Configuration...</i> saves the current appearance of your Histo-Scope
session (excluding opening the file or making the connection).  <i>Load
Configuration...</i> re-loads these files.  Configuration files are an editable
but undocumented ASCII text file format.  These features are available from the
<i>File/Process</i> menu of the Histo-Scope Main Window.<p>
<p>
Multi-plot windows are windows containing several plots arranged in a grid
pattern.  They can be created automatically to display all of the histograms
defined in a single category, or they can be created manually by beginning with
an empty window, and dragging plots from other windows, including plots derived
from Ntuple data.  To create a Multi-plot window, select <i>Multiple Plot
Window...</i> from the <i>Windows</i> menu of the Histo-Scope Main Window.  <p>
<p>
The Ntuple Window now has a new button "Create Variable" which allows you to
create "virtual" Ntuple variables derived from the real variables, constants,
and random values.  The new variables are specified as FORTRAN or C style
expressions, with many built-in functions and constants.<p>
<p>
XY Plots in previous versions of Histo-Scope meant a single X variable vs. one
or more Y variables, with the Y variables plotted against an X axis which was
sorted on increasing values of X.  This style of plot is still available as the
"Sorted XY Plot" in the Ntuple Window; however a more rational, unsorted, X vs.
Y plot is now also available which can be used to plot XY point pairs, either
using connected lines, or markers alone.  An XY Plot with no lines acts as an
alternative representation to the Scatter Plot, with points represented by
larger, more visible markers and optional error bars.  Up to nine (or three
with errors) distinct sets of points can be plotted in the same plot.<p>
<p>
PostScript resolution has been improved in some of the plots, and more
information is now included on printed and PostScript plots.  Window titles are
now included, and plot statistics will appear to the side of the plot if
<i>Show Statistics</i> is selected from the Plot Settings menu before selecting
<i>Print...</i> or <i>Generate PostScript.... </i><p>

To create a plot window containing more than one plot, select <i>Multiple Plot
Windows</i>... from the Windows menu of the Histo-Scope Main Window.  The
Create Multiple Plot Window allows the user to select plots to appear together
in one larger window.  This is helpful for grouping plots together that are
related in some way and provides a mechanism that makes all the selected
mini-plots visible at the same time.<p>

<p>
There are two ways these multiple-plot windows can be populated with plots:<p>
<p>
1)	All the 1-D and 2-D Histograms in the current category (as listed in the
Histo-Scope Main Window) can be displayed in a single multi-plot window.  To do
this, click on the <i>Use Current Category</i> push button.  Histo-Scope will
automatically fill in the multi-plot window title and a default number of rows
and columns that will accommodate the number of histograms in the current
category.  The window title, # Rows, and # Columns can be modified by the user
as desired.<p>
<p>
2)	For more flexibility, <u>don't</u> press the <i>Use Current Category</i>
button.  Instead just type the window title and number of rows and columns for
the Multiple Plot window, and after pressing "Create Window" use the mouse to
drag the plots one-by-one into the initially empty multi-plot window.  This
method gives you the most flexibility for choosing and placing plots for
display. <p>
<p>
Click on the <i>Create Window</i> button to create the Multiple Plot window.
To insert plots of Ntuple variables into a multiple plot window, leave one or
more mini-plot "cells" empty and use the middle mouse button to drag a plot
onto the empty cell of the mini-plot.  (To drag the plot, press the middle
mouse button while the pointer is over the plot area of the desired Ntuple
plot, and, while holding the mouse button down, move the mouse pointer over to
the empty mini-plot area, and then release the middle mouse button.  When you
press the middle mouse button, the pointer changes to indicate that your are
initiating a drag.)<p>

<p>
To change the size of the individual plots in Multiple Plot windows, use Motif
window controls such as the window sides or corners to make the entire window
larger or smaller.<p>
<p>
Each mini-plot in the Multiple Plot window allows you to adjust its plot
settings in a manner similar to the individual plot windows.  To bring up a
Plot Settings menu, point to the plot with the mouse and press the right mouse
button.</a><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">XY
Plot
</a></h2>
<p>
An XY Plot plots pairs of points in two dimensions.  The points are taken in
sequence from the Ntuple and are initially drawn with lines connecting the
points and no markers.  The XY Plot can also be used as an alternative to the
Scatter Plot.  In this case, use the Set Mark and Line Style plot adjustment to
turn on markers and turn off connecting lines.  (When the number of points is
small, the marks drawn by the XY Plot are much more visible than the
pixel-sized dots drawn by the Scatter Plot.)  The XY Plot can also plot
multiple sets of variable X-Y pairs from the Ntuple, distinguish them with
different marker styles, and draw both horizontal and vertical error bars.  Up
to nine X-Y pairs can be plotted in one window.  To reveal additional
assignment buttons, use the mouse to grab the bottom frame of the Ntuple Window
and pull downward.  The window will grow as you move the mouse pointer
downward. <p>
<p>

Figure 26. Sorted XY  Plot<p>
<p>
Since the points in an XY Plot are not sorted the initial appearance of the
plot may include lines which loop back on themselves.  Another type of XY Plot
is the <b>Sorted XY Plot</b>.  In a Sorted XY Plot, the x-axis variable is
sorted in order of increasing value and each succeeding variable is plotted
along the y-axis against the first (sorted) variable.  This can often be a
better way to observe how y varies with x.  A Sorted XY Plot can display up to
seventeen Y-variables in one window.  If only one Y-variable is plotted, its
name appears at the top of the y-axis.  If more than one is plotted, a legend
of variable names appears at the bottom of the plot.<p>
<p>
Both types of XY Plots allow you to specify variables as error values.  An XY
Plot w/Errors can plot up to three X-Y pairs with their corresponding vertical
and horizontal errors.  A Sorted XY Plot w/Errors can plot up to five
Y-variables and their corresponding (vertical) errors.  (To expose hidden plot
variable assignments, drag the bottom frame of the Ntuple window downward with
the mouse.  The window will grow downward as you pull.)<p>
