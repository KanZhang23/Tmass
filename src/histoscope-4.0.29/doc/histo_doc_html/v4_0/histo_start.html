Part I - Using the Histo-Scope Program

<h2>
<a name="1">Getting Started with Histo-Scope
</a><br>
</h2>
<p>
The Histo-Scope program is the "scope" part of the tool.  It can be run
independently or invoked directly from a user's program.  If you are not 
using the workstation console display, and have instead used telnet or 
rlogin to access the host system, you will need to let the operating system
know which display you are using:<a href="HistoScopeV3_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a> <p>
Set the DISPLAY environment variable:<p>
<p>
	% <i>setenv DISPLAY</i><i> devicename:0</i><p>
<p>

For example, <i>setenv DISPLAY fnpspc.fnal.gov:0</i> tells the X software on a
Unix host to use your X display fnpspc.fnal.gov.<p>
<p>
Next, set up Histo-Scope by typing:<a href="HistoScopeV3_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a>
<p>
<p>
        % <i>setup histo</i><p>
<p>
And, if running Histo-Scope directly, type:<p>
<p>
	% <i>histo</i><p>
<p>

You should shortly see Histo-Scope's Main Window pop up.  If you experience 
any problems with starting or running Histo-Scope please refer to the sections 
on <A HREF="histo_release.html"><b>Release Notes</b></A> and <A
HREF="histo_release.html#8"><b>Setup</b></A>.  If invoking Histo-Scope from your own program, 
please refer to<A HREF="histo_pt3.html"> <b>Part III</A> - Histo-Scope Library Subroutines</b> in this guide.<p>
<p>
Optionally, if you want to view a Histo-Scope data file, you can specify this
file to open on the Histo-Scope command line.  If you would like to specify an
HBOOK file to open on the command line, preceed the HBOOK filename with "-hbook
".   For example, on Unix:<p>
<p>
% <i>histo histoFile.hs</i><p>
% <i>histo -hbook hbookfile.hst</i><p>

<p>

When listing an hbook file on the Histo-Scope command line, you can also
specify a blocksize to use to open the file by preceeding the block size with
"-blocksize ".  For example:<p>
<p>
% <i>histo -hbook hbookfile.hst -blocksize  1024</i><p>

Another command line option is to specify a clientid causing Histo-Scope
to connect directly to a client process that is currently running.  The
clientid is the string which is passed to hs_initialize in your client program.
You can optionally specify a hostname by including the -rhost argument and a
username by including the -ruser argument.  These options are only required
if your client is running on a remote host or under another username.
<p>
% <i>histo -clientid clientname -rhost hostname -ruser username</i><p>

You can also specify a configuration file to open automatically by using the 
-config argument.  This will re-load a previously saved configuration file
which contains commands for opening windows, scaling plots, adjusting plot
appearances, setting slider positions, etc. For further information, see page
21. 
<p>
% <i>histo -config file.cfg </i><p>

The -clientid and -config arguments can be used together.  Histo-Scope would
first connect to the client process and then the configuration file would be
read.
