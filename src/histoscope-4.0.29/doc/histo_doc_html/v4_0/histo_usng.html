Figure 6.  Histo-Scope's Main Window<p>
<p>
When you run Histo-Scope or invoke it from a program, the main window pops up.
This window allows you to specify how Histo-Scope should access your data and
which data items to view.  Unless Histo-Scope was invoked from a running
program, the <i>Category</i> pull-down menu and the <i>Sub Categories</i> and <i>Histogram/Ntuple/Indicator/Control</i> 
list boxes are greyed out.  This is because you need to tell Histo-Scope to 
open a file or connect to a running process.
 (If Histo-Scope was invoked from a running program, the File/Process menu is
replaced by a <i>Window</i> menu, and histograms, Ntuples, and other data items
in the top-level category are automatically listed.)   <p>
<p><a name = "a">
Histo-Scope</a> supports the notion of categories, equivalent to HBOOK's
directories, for arranging large numbers of histograms and Ntuples in a
hierarchy rather than in a single long list.  You can navigate through the
hierarchy by clicking on items in the "Category" list on the left side of the
Histo-Scope window or by using the Category pull-down menu:<p>

Figure 8.  File/Process Pull-down Menu<p>
<p>
<p>
You can use the <i>File/Process</i> pull-down menu in the menu bar to perform
the following functions:<p>
<p>	
			<i>(Accelerator Key):</i><p>
<p>
<i>Open Histo-Scope File...	(Ctrl O)</i><p>
<p>
Histo-Scope will pop-up a file selection box through which you can
specify the filename of the Histo-Scope format file. Then Histo-Scope will read
the file and display the items it has read from the file.  If you already have
a file open or are connected to a process, Histo-Scope will first ask you if
you want to close or disconnect before the file selection box appears.<p>
<p>
<i>Open HBOOK File...	(Ctrl H)</i><p>
<p>
Histo-Scope will pop-up a file selection box through which you can
specify the filename of the HBOOK file. Then Histo-Scope will read the file and
display the items it has read from the file.  If you already have a file open
or are connected to a process, Histo-Scope will first ask you if you want to
close or disconnect before the file selection box appears.<p>
<p>
<i>Connect to Process...	(Ctrl N)</i><p>
<p>
Histo-Scope will pop-up a dialog box that lists all processes on the
machine Histo-Scope was run from that it can connect to.  If desired, a remote
node name can be entered and the processes Histo-Scope can connect to on that
machine will be listed.  Pressing the Connect button or double-clicking on a
process requests Histo-Scope to connect to the highlighted or selected process.
Once the connection is established, Histo-Scope will display the top-level
items and sub-categories of data items that Histo-Scope can access from that
process. When selecting <i>Connect to Process</i>, if you already have a file
open or are connected to another process, Histo-Scope will first ask you if you
want to close or disconnect before it pops up the Connect to Process dialog
box.</a><p>
<p>
<p>
<i>Re-Read Same File	(Ctrl R)</i><p>
<p>
If you currently have a file open, you can select <i>Re-Read Same
File</i> to update Histo-Scope with new data that may have been written to the
file since Histo-Scope opened it.  To ensure that all your plot windows reflect
new data, Histo-Scope will close all plot windows (after checking that it's OK
to do this) before re-reading the file.<p>
<p><a name="6">
<i>Close File/Connection</i><p></a>
<p>
Selecting <i>Close File/Connection</i> allows you to close a file or
connection, but leaves all displayed plots available for viewing.  If you were
connected to a process, no more updating will occur.<p>
<p>
<i>Load Configuration	(Ctrl L)</i><p>
<p>
Configuration files are files of Histo-Scope commands for opening windows,
scaling plots, adjusting plot appearance, setting slider positions, etc.
<i>Save Configuration</i>... saves the current appearance of your Histo-Scope
session (excluding opening the file or making the connection).  <i>Load
Configuration</i> re-loads these configuration files.  Use <i>Load
Configuration</i> after you have opened a data file or connected to a 
process.  More than one configuration file can be loaded in a single session.
Loading additional files simply displays the additional plots specified in
the new files.  Note that configuration files do not specify the file or 
connection to be opened, nor do they specify Preferences settings. 
Configuration files are an editable but undocumented ASCII text file format.<p>
<p>
<i>Save Configuration	(Ctrl S)</i><p>
<p>
<i>Save Configuration</i> saves the current appearanceof your Histo-Scope 
session (excluding opening the file or making the connection) to a file
which can later be loaded with <i>Load Configuration</i>.  Histo-Scope will
pop up a file selection box through which you can specify the file name 
of the configuration file.  Note that configuration files do not specify 
the file or connection to be opened, nor do they specify Preferences settings.
Configuration files are an editable but undocumented ASCII text file format.<p>
<p> <a name="5">
<i>Exit		(F3)</i></A><p>
<p>
Histo-Scope will exit.<p>
<p>
After opening a file or connecting to a process, Histo-Scope will change the
title in the title bar from "Histo-Scope" to the filename or process you
specified.  Also, the histograms, Ntuples, and other data items belonging to
the top-level category will be listed.  The <i>Category</i> pull-down menu and
<i>Sub Categories</i> list box can be used to select sub-categories and
navigate through the category (or HBOOK directory) structure for your data.  To
select a sub-category, click on it and press the <i>Open</i> button, or just
double-click on the sub-category. <p>
<p>
To view a histogram, Ntuple or other data item, first,
select the one or more items that you are interested in.  If you have one item
to select, simply point to it with the mouse and either click on it once and
then press the <i>View</i> button, or just double-click on the item in the list
box.  If you have more than one item to view, there are a few different ways to
select them.  If they are contiguous items in the list, you can press the left
mouse button and drag the mouse over the items you wish to select, then release
the button.  A second way to do this same thing would be to point and click on
the first item, then move the mouse to the last item you wish to select and
point and click on that item while holding down the key.  Then you can press
the <i>View</i> button.  If you want to select items that are not contiguous in
the list, select the first item (or group of items) as described above, then
move the mouse to the next item and select it by pointing and clicking on that
item while holding down the key.  Then you can select the <i>View</i> button to
display the plots.  <p>
<p>
If the items selected are all 1D Histograms or groups, you should notice that
two additional <i>View</i> buttons will become sensitive to mouse-clicks, the
<i>View Overlaid</i> button and the <i>View Multiple</i> button. The<i>View
Overlaid</i> button will cause the plots to be displayed overlaid on each other
and the <i>View Multiple</i> button will cause the plots to be displayed in a
multiple plot window.  If one or more items selected is a 2D Histogram, you can
view it in a multiple plot window, but it cannot be overlaid.  Therefore, only
the <i>View</i> and <i>View Multiple</i> buttons will be sensitive.  When
viewing a histogram, indicator, control, or trigger a plot window will pop up
displaying the item using the default style for that type of data.   When
requesting an Ntuple, the Ntuple Window will first appear to allow you to
specify various kinds of plots and variable assignments.  <p>
<p><a name="5a">
When the item selected </a>is a group, the <i>View</i> button will display the
items in the group according to the group type specified by the user program
that created the group (see HS_CREATE_GROUP).  Thus plots will be displayed
individually, in a multiple-plot window, or in an overlaid plot window,
according to this default group type.  The <i>View Multiple</i> and <i>View
Overlaid</i> buttons override the default behavior.<p>
<p>
<a name="3">
Once an item is displayed,</a> you can change the presentation style via pop-up
menus from the plot or indicator window using the third (right) mouse button
(see section <A HREF="histo_set.html"> <b>Adjusting Plot Settings</b></A>).  
The plots can also be rescaled by changing the window size, dragging on the 
axis tick marks, or typing new endpoint values in the Axis Settings dialog.  
Two-dimensional histogram and 3D scatter plots also allow rotation of the plot 
in space.  Any number of histograms, Ntuples, plots of Ntuples, or alternate 
views of histograms and Ntuples can be displayed simultaneously in separate 
windows, and all plots can be printed.  Further details on the capabilities 
and functions of each data/plot type can be found in subsequent sections of 
this guide. <p>

Figure 9.  Preferences Pull-down Menu<p>
<p>
The <a name="4"> Preferences pull-down menu </a>in the menu bar allows you to 
specify:<p>
<p>
* how often Histo-Scope should request new data from a connected process, <p>
<p>
* to set/unset buffer graphics mode, <p>
<p>
* to set/unset whether plot help windows pop up the first time you view that
kind of plot, and <p>
<p>
* to save your preferences of the above.  <p>
<p>
<i>Update Frequency</i>...<p>
<p>
Update frequency is used only when connected to a running process.  The
default value is set to three seconds, meaning that every three seconds
Histo-Scope will request new data from the connected process.  To change the
update frequency, use the mouse to drag the slider bar to the value you desire.
Increasing this value will save CPU time at the cost of a longer interval
between plot updates.<p>
<p>
<i>Buffer Graphics</i><p>
<p>
Initially Buffer Graphics mode is off (indicated by the absence of the
square toggle button to the left of the words <i>Buffer Graphics</i>.  Graphics
buffering changes the way Histo-Scope draws moving graphics in X-Windows.
Depending on your X-Windows server or X-Terminal, turning on buffered graphics
may either improve or degrade animation quality.  Whether your hardware will
run well with buffer graphics turned on depends on a number of relatively
complicated factors.  The best way to find out is just to try it.  Before you
do, however, note that some X-Terminals and PC based X servers may not have
enough memory to run properly in buffered graphics mode.  When an X server runs
out of memory, it will kill the process that made the last memory request, or
in some cases, crash itself.  Most X-Terminals and PC X servers with limited
memory capacity have some kind of memory display that you can invoke to monitor
their memory usage.  It is advisable to monitor your X server's memory usage
the first time you use buffered graphics.  The amount of memory that
Histo-Scope needs for buffered graphics is dependent on the number and size of
plot windows that you have open.<p>

<i>Automatic Plot Help  </i></a><p>
<p>
For new users, Histo-Scope will by default pop up a window that explains
how to interact with the type of plot just displayed the first time that kind
of plot is viewed.  Experienced Histo-Scope users will probably want to unset
this option and save their preferences. <p>
<p>
<i>Save Preferences  </i><p>
<p>
Any of the above preferences can be set and then saved to a file which is
automatically  re-loaded every time Histoscope is started.  Selecting <i>Save
Preferences</i> generates this file in your home directory (Unix) with the 
name .histo .</a><p>

Figure 10. Windows Pull-down Menu<p>
<p>
The <i>Windows</i> pull-down menu in the menu bar lists all of the currently 
displayed plot windows.  Selecting one will bring that plot to the front of 
all other windows. In addition to the list of plot windows, the <i>Windows</i> menu 
also allows the user to close all plot windows and create a window containing 
multiple plots:<p>

<p><i>Close All Windows</i><p>
<p>
Selecting <i>Close All Windows</i> closes all of the open plot windows without
closing the currently open file or connection to an attached process.  <p>
<p>
<p><i>Multiple Plot Window...</i><p>
<p>
Selecting <i>Multiple Plot Window...</i> will pop up a window which allows the
user to select plots to appear together in one larger window.  This is helpful
for grouping plots together that are related in some way and provides a
mechanism that makes all the selected mini-plots visible at the same time.<p>
<p>
Histo-Scope also provides a <i>Help</i> menu which gives online help to the
user. </a>
