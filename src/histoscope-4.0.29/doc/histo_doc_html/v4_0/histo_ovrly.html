Overlay Plots
</h2><p>
An overlay plot is the result of using the "View Overlaid" button
in the main panel, viewing a plot group whose group type is
H_OVERLAY, or dragging one plot over another.  Some of the features
and options offered for the original plots are not available in the
overlaid state.  To access these features, you must remove the plot
from the overlay (use "Remove Overlayed Plot"), re-create it
individually, and merge it back in to the overlay.  Sliders,
including rebin sliders, in an overlayed plot, refer to the
original plot, to which others plots have been dragged.<p>
<p>
Interactive sliders and rebinning can still be used on the original
(bottom) plot in the overlay.  The menu items: Show Statistics, Show
Sliders, and Show Rebin Slider, all refer to this original plot.
