So do you want to hear about the wedding? Larry, Nemo, Mindy, Bridgett
and other assorted people you may or may not know?

O.K. We got in Friday afternoon right before dinner. We needed to buy a
present for Walgren so we headed out to Marshall Fields on state street.
I remember you and I had gone to a Marshall Fields together but I don't
think it was on State Street, I think it was at Water Tower place or
something like that. Anyhow, on the way out we ran into Jon Meyers
(Yorkie) do you remember him? I didn't recognize him at first, he had
put on probably 70 lbs since school and he was pretty grey but as soon as
he started talking I knew who it was (I had to tell him to stop talking
so fast). I met his wife too, Sherry, a very pretty woman, who had that
sophisticated urban look. we ended up spending a good deal of time with
them. Anyhow, soon after Colin Andersen came up (this was in the lobby).
I hadn't seen him since probably my first year at Drake. He was my RA my
first year there (a senior). He looked practically the same. Anyhow, it
was great seeing both of them, but they were in a hurry to get to the
rehearsal dinner and Ann and I were in a hurry to get a present so we
promised to catch up later in the evening. Ann and I cabbed it to
Marshall Fields and then afterwards went to an Italian restaurant called
Tucci Milano or something like that. Have you ever been there? What type
of Italian is it where they don't have spaghetti? Anyhow, that's what it
was. Ann really wanted spaghetti and they didn't have it, but I thought
it was pretty good and I think she did too despite no spaghetti. By this
time it was pretty late so we went back to the room and  I thought we
would call it a night but York called me and said they were all in the
lounge, so I went down to the lounge and Yorkie, Colin, and Walgren were
there along with a couple of other people. This one friend of Jake's
from L.A. was there and he passed out aat the table, so we played
perverse tricks on him, until he woke up, Anyhow, we ended going out for
a couple of hours to a couple of bars and called it a night. 

We slept pretty late, and the next day Larry called and we met him in
the lobby before the wedding. He looks more like Rodney Dangerfield
every time I see him. Mindy looked exactly the same -- I hadn't seen her
in at least 5 years. Ann had not seen either of them since their
wedding. Anyhow, we went over to the wedding and were taking bets on
whether Nemo would show. Right before the wedding started, Nemo makes
his gran entrnace with Bridget. It reminded me of the scene from the Big
Chill, where William Hurt comes into the church right before the start
of the funeral. He looks a lot different, he is really grey and his hair
has receded a lot, but he is still a good looking guy. A cross between
Sting and Clint Eastwood (or so Ann thinks). He was with Bridget.
Anyhow, the wedding was Catholic but mercifully short (did you have a
long wddding? and then it was off to the reception. The reception was
great. It was so much fun seeing all these people I hadn't seen in so
long. I hadn't seen Nemo since Larry's wedding even though I had talked
to him on the phone a few times. It was fun catching up with Larry and
Mindy. I kept on trying to talk Larry and Mindy into meeting us at
Myrtle Beach -- Mindy was up for it of course, but Larry wouldn't
commit. I have a pretty good idea why, but I can't say for sure.
Everyone was afraid to ask Nemo what he was up to, but Mindy asked him
and he says he is a graphic designer for a sign company and a football
coach. He said he would meet us in Chicago if it wasn't during coaching
season. You know that Larry spends a lot of time at work these days and
traveling for work. I came to the conclusion that Larry is not too happy
at home. I can see why. Mindy didn't pass up a chance to take little
jabs at him whenever she could -- mostly about being a people pleaser
(except he tries to please everyone but me, she says) and not paying
enough attention to her and the kids. I got the impression that it was
one of those vicious cycle things where she is always on his case for
not being home and he stays away more because her constant picking is
kind of aversive. I forgot that they got married in a hurry. They were
living together within two weeks on knowing each other and were engaged
within a couple of months. I think they were married in less than a year
from meeting each other and she was pregnant one month after getting
married. Larry talks a lot about partying and stuff, and she doesn't
drink and hates drugs.  I think she is used to getting her way on
everything -- and I never really thought of it when I lived with him,
but Larry was a very tolerant, people pleasing person like Mindy says
even back then.

Nemo was as enigmatic as ever. He didn't have much to say about what he
was doing, but he remembers so many stories from our Drake days, that he
spent almost the whole night reminding us of things that had happened.
It was really funny hearing all those stories again. I hardly rememer
half the things. I think I burned too many brain cells back then. You
probably don't remember many of these people, but Bridgett was there. We
all thougt she was gay but she talked a lot about the boyfriend she was
living with and what she was doing She was only at Drake a year, from 82
- 83 and then dropped ou but like so many others, she hung out there a
lot. She is now studying to be a teacher and is a part-time bartender.
Nemo didn't mention anything about a significant other, and we were all
afraid to ask -- Mindy didn't even ask. Yorkie is a school teacher on
Long Island as is his wife. Others from Drake that were there were Bob
Harvey (a college professor now), Tom Simpson, and CJ and his wife, both
people from Drake. Larry called him his "competition". Anyhow, CJ came
up to me and introduced himself (I knew who he was and was going to talk
to him but he beat me to the punch). He works for the CBS affiliate in
Minneapolis and entertains Walgren whenever he comes to town for the
Bulls and Whitesox games. Anyhow, we didn't talk long mostly because we
hardly knew each other at Drake, but he remembered me and I asked him
about Linda, he really didn't seem to want to talk about her I think
because his wife was there and it seemed it might have been a sore
subject between the two (maybe I am reading more into it). Anyhow, I
don't remember her name, I think it might have started with an M. She
went to Drake and was his age. She looked older than him, probably
because he still looks so young. It looked like he was trying to grow a
beard and was wearing those small oval shaped glasses that are so trendy
these days and was carrying a bunch of photo equipment, very much the
journalist look. His wife is a free-lance producer with the same station
as CJ, so she helps produce stuff with Walgren when he comes to town.
Anyhow, he asked about Sonia and remembered that you and I were an item
and asked about you and I of course had to lie and tell him I have no
idea what ever happened to you. Luckily Ann wasn't around. I might have
been paranoid.
So.. the reception ended.  More than one person said that I am really 
mellow now compared to the person they knew at Drake. The DJ played a 
lot of songs that were popular when we were in school, so it was like a
college reunion. Much more fun, than I thought possible, I forgot how
much I liked some of those people. Anyhow after the reception (it ended
at 8:00), we all went up to Ray's room at the hotel and continued the
party. After a couple of hours there, we all decided to go to the bars
so Pam Gaffigan decided to join us. Do you remember her? So Ann and
Larry were in the mood for listening to a blues band, so we headed out
looking for a band, but the place we wanted to go had a line, so we
decided to all meet at this bar in Wrigleyville (Ann and me, Larry,
Mindy, Pam, her roomate, Yorkie, and his wife, Nemo, and Bridgett. So..
before we knew it, Bridgett and Nemo jumped in a cab and told us they
would meet us, and the rest of us jumped into cabs and we all met up
there -- except, surprise!, Nemo and Bridgett never showed and Yorkie's
wife decided to go back to the hotel. What was kind of annoying was that
Mindy said she wasn't interest in going either, but for whatever reason,
she decided to go, and then right after we got there insisted that Larry
take her home. So Larry was really bummed and had to go home right away.
Pam, her roomate, Yorkie, and Ann and I stayed and drank until about
3:30 and then went on to McDonalds and made it home about 4:30. everyone
was speculating that Pam and her roomate were gay (she looked really
"butch"). The roomate didn't.I talked to them for probably 3 hours, but
the bar was so noisy and I was drinking and I can't remember her name.
Do you remember a person by the name of Ann Trotter? Anyhow, the next
day there was a brunch, so most of us went to that except Ann, and of
course Nemo and Bridgett (as usual Nemo leaves without even saying
goodbye). and that was about it. We all talked about trying to organize
a get together maybe at Hilon Head or maybe Drake relays. It was so
much fun seeing all these people again. Ann said that she could tell we
were all checking each other out. I guess that is how it is at
reunions.... but nobody talked much about their jobs. Mostly it was
about their kids and old times. So.. Larry and I didn't get much of a
chance to talk except on the way to the airport (between bouts of Mindy
complaining about this and that). 

So what do you think?
