Release Notes
</h2>

<b>
<a name="1">Requirements</b>
- Histo-Scope requires an X-based workstation (DEC-ULTRIX, DEC-OSF/1,
SGI UNIX, Sun (Solaris) UNIX, or IBM/Risc UNIX) or an X Terminal or X-based
workstation that can connect to one of these hosts.

<b>
<a name="3">HBOOK Circular Ntuple Support -</b> 
Histo-Scope now supports, in a limited way, the display of data in the new 
HBOOK Circular Ntuple data structure.  Because HBOOK does not, at the current 
time, provide a way for Histo-Scope to inquire the current "insertion point" 
of the circular buffer, and because the user can at any time change the fills 
from circular to linear and back again, Histo-Scope uses the following algorithm for determining that an HBOOK Ntuple is circular
and entries should be re-sent from the data generating process to the scope
starting from the first entry (row):
</a>
<p>
* The number of entries in the Ntuple is nonzero<p>
<p>
* The total number of entries is identical to the number recorded at the
previous call to hs_update<p>
<p>
* Any element (column) of the first row in the currently displayed Ntuple plot
is different from the corresponding element of the first row now in the HBOOK
Ntuple<p>
<p>
Note that this strategy will fail if the HBOOK Ntuple is filled circularly with
data that is exactly the same in the first row as what was there before.  It
will also fail if the "insertion point" changed without changing the data in
the first Ntuple row.  In these cases, the Ntuple viewed by the Histo-Scope
user will still be the old data, rather than the new.<p>

<b>
<a name="4">UNIX restriction on putting Histo-Scope process in background - </b>
If you are running Histo-Scope on a UNIX system, do not put the Histo-Scope 
process in the background if you plan to connect to a process.  This is because
the system may put the Histo-Scope process into a wait state that it will not 
get out of until the process is put into the foreground.  After the connection 
is successful, the Histo-Scope process may be put into the background, if 
necessary, until you need to connect to another process. 
</a>
<p>
<b>
<a name="5">Some X-Servers do not destroy child dialog windows -</b> 
Some, possibly older, X-Terminals and servers do not properly destroy dialogs 
when the parent window is destroyed.  On these servers doing anything with 
these orphan windows can cause Histo-Scope to terminate with an error such as 
Segmentation Violation.  To avoid this on X servers with this problem, be sure 
to close slider, statistics, and axis settings windows before closing their 
corresponding plot window. 
</a>
<p>
<b>
<a name="6">Printer Options window delay - </b>
Occasionally while printing a plot using flpr you may experience a delay for 
up to a minute.  This is usually because the host you have specified is wrong 
or the queue does not exist.  After the delay, Histo-Scope will display the 
error that occurred.
</a>
<p>
<b>
<a name="8">Setting up Histo-Scope on UNIX without Fermilab's ups/upd -</b> 
For off-site UNIX users of Histo-Scope without ups/upd, the add the following 
commands to your .cshrc file:
</a>
<p>
setenv HISTO_DIR <i>path-to-Histo-Scope</i><p>
<i></i>set path = ($PATH, $HISTO_DIR/bin)<p>
<p>
These variables must be defined before invoking Histo-Scope.  They must also be
added to your .cshrc file on any node you intend to call the Histo-Scope
library routine hs_histoscope.  If you will be building programs with
Histo-Scope library routines, also define:<p>
<p>
setenv HISTO_INC $HISTO_DIR/include<i></i><p>
