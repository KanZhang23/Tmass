The new code is in the directory /home/igv/TopJes/Scripts/Priors_2015

============================================================================

The MC integration code is using the following priors:

1) Jet momentum (p/E) transfer functions:

     transfer_function.h
     Configurables/transfer_function.c
     randomize_jet_energy.h
     randomize_jet_energy.c

   The code to create these transfer functions is in the directory
   /home/igv/TF_code on the laptop (also /home/ivolobou/TF_code
   on antaeus). The main file is called "fit_ratio_nonparametric.tcl".
   The ntuples are prepared with the "prepare_mc_efficiency_ntuple.tcl"
   script which can be found in the directory /home/igv/Efficiency_calculator
   on the laptop or in the directory /home/igv/Efficiency_calculator on pdsf.

2) Angular transfer functions. There are two types: with and without
   parton mass dependence. The transfer functions with parton mass
   dependence are in files

     angular_transfer_function.h
     Configurables/angular_transfer_function.c

   Old code to create these functions is on the laptop, files
   create_angular_ntuple.tcl, fit_angle_tfs.tcl, plot_angular_tfs.tcl,
   format_angular_parameters.tcl, etc., in the directory
   /home/igv/TopJes/Scripts/Propagators_newmodel.

   New code is in the directory /home/igv/TF_code, file
   fit_angle_nonparametric.tcl. On antaeus, the script is in
   the directory /home/ivolobou/TF_code.

   The transfer functions without parton mass dependence are in

     random_jet_angles.h
     Configurables/random_jet_angles.c

   Apparently, these functions were created by some old version of the
   "fit_angle_tfs.tcl" script, perhaps 
   /home/igv/TopJes/Scripts/Propagators_newmodel/fit_angle_tfs.tcl.v1
   on the laptop.

3) Parton mass distributions:

     random_parton_mass.h
     Configurables/random_parton_mass.c

   Old version, in which mq and mqbar are assumed to be independent:
   Created by "create_parton_mass_generator.tcl" script on PDSF:
   /home/igv/TopJes/Scripts/create_parton_mass_generator.tcl. Note
   that only the arrays of constants should be replaced in file
   "random_parton_mass.c", the functions themselves are not standard
   and can not be created automatically.

   Last time the script was used like this:

   create_parton_mass_generator.tcl 10000 /eliza11/cdf/igv/Pythia_hepg_ntuples/parton_mass_ntuple.hs /eliza11/cdf/igv/Pythia_hepg_ntuples/newparse_pythia_{14,15,16,17,18,19}*hs

   New version:
   Use the "fit_q_mass_tail.tcl" script on the ntuple file written by
   the "create_parton_mass_generator.tcl" script. The "fit_q_mass_tail.tcl"
   script must be run by hstclsh. It is on laptop, in the directory
   /home/igv/TopJes/Scripts.

4) The ttbar Pt distribution. This distribution currently depends
   on the top mass. The relevant files are

     generate_ttbar_pt.h
     gen_ttbar_pt_massdep.h
     generate_ttbar_pt.c
     Configurables/gen_ttbar_pt_massdep.c

   The top mass library should use only the functions provided by
   "generate_ttbar_pt.h". These functions, in turn, may or may not
   use functions from "gen_ttbar_pt_massdep.h".

   The relevant scripts are "create_ttbar_pt_generator.tcl" and
   "create_ttbar_pt_ntuple.tcl" in the directory
   /home/igv/TopJes/Scripts on the laptop.

   Last use:
   create_ttbar_pt_generator.tcl ttbar_pt_ntuple_pythia.hs gen_ttbar_pt_massdep 1000 0.5

5) The lepton momentum transfer function. Used only for smearing but
   not in the integration code:

     random_lepton_momentum.h
     Configurables/random_lepton_momentum.c

   It is assumed to be gaussian. The relevant scripts are on the laptop:
   /home/igv/TopJes/Scripts/Propagators_newmodel/lepton_resolution_ntuples.tcl
   /home/igv/TopJes/Scripts/Propagators_newmodel/lepton_resolution.tcl

6) Top and W masses. Currently Breit-Wigners (in Mt and MW^2).

7) Prior in log(pq/pqbar). Currently flat within some limits. Realized
   internally inside "mc_topmass_integrator.c".

8) Angular prior for an "extra", unobserved jet. Flat in cos(theta) and
   phi. Realized internally inside "mc_topmass_integrator.c", function
   "random_dir_jet".

9) The prior for the tau daughter spectrum. The relevant functions are
   "tau_daughter_spectrum" and "average_tau_polarization" in files

     tau_pt_spectrum.h
     Configurables/tau_pt_spectrum.c

   The relevant scripts are "fit_polarization.tcl" and
   "fit_polarization_pmu.tcl" in the directory /home/igv/Updated_herw
   on the laptop.

10) Probabilities to gain an extra (ISR) jet and to loose a jet produced in
    a ttbar decay. One might need to use special transfer functions in
    conjunction with these probabilities. The relevant files are:

    single_jet_probs.h
    single_jet_probs.c
    Configurables/single_jet_probabilities.c
