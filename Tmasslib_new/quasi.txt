Initialization of the random number sequence:
L 924-930 in mc_topmass_integrator.c. Note that some of the QMC points
are skipped inside "fill_quasi_mc_grid" which is probably a bug in the
logic (not in the code) -- the convergence assumptions may later be
violated because we are no longer checking for convergence only after
2^K points.

Up to 19-dim QMC integration (N_MC_DIMS, defined in mc_topmass_integrator.h,
is 19). The actual dimensionality is flexible and configurable. On top
of that, we have 1-d regular grid integration in either the leptonic W
mass squared or neutrino Pz. Regular grid integration is needed in order
to avoid singularities in the phase space Jacobian.

The results are filled using the "norm_accumulate" function in the file
"mc_topmass_integrator.c". This is done in two places: on line 1439 and
line 1932. It looks like the simplest way to proceed would be to replace
these calls with calls to another function which will internally call
both "norm_accumulate" and the code which calculates the new error.

The memory for the results is allocated on line 972. This memory is
treated, basically, as a 3-d array, with dimensionalities
[n_jet_permutations, n_tmass_points, n_jes_points].

The decision when to stop integrating is made by the function
"is_scan_complete". This is the most important function to understand
and, potentially, replace. It returns the current decision (called
"status") of the scan and also tells the integration code which
permutations should be concentrated upon (sets "current_perm_mask").
