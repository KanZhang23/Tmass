1. Tau polarization.

fixed! 2. Do we need Mt-dependent ttbar Pt model?

3. We need a model for the "prob_to_acquire_jet" and "prob_to_loose_parton"
   functions.

4. Validation of the priors.

5. Fix the pull width correction in the background model.

6. Can we include events without b tags?

fixed! 7. Switch to sigma units in JES

8. Fix Sobol sequences

fixed! 9. Check how the leptonic side solutions are chosen when the
       leptonic side b is "extra".

10. Work out normalization factors for pt/Et transfer function.
