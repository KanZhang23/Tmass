This code assumes that you have the "hs" tcl extension installed on
your system. To run the server, set the "port" variable in the file
"unique_int_server.tcl" to some number of your choosing between 49152
and 65535 (that is, if you want to be IANA-compliant, see
http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml).
Also, update the "allowed_hosts" setings. If you are using this server
with the "Mt_master_worker" code, note that only the director program
will access the server, so that the host on which the director runs
must be apended to the "allowed_hosts" list. Make sure that the port
you selected is not protected by a firewall from the director (or set
up an ssh tunnel appropriately).

When the proper port and permissions are set up, you can simply run
the server in the background from your own account:

nohup ./unique_int_server.tcl >& unique_int_server.log &

This will automatically compile and load the little tcl extension in
the "nextint.c" file using the "hs" extension facilities. The code is
in C in order to use 64-bit integers as tcl built-in integers are
32-bit.
