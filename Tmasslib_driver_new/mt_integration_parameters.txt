Integration Parameters
----------------------

The current code supports only quasi-MC integration. The code parameters
described below are defined in the "scan_parameters.c" file.

"print_integration_parameters" -- This instructs the system to print
                         integration parameters to the standard output
                         before the first event is integrated. The
                         default value is 0 (do not print).

"fill_result_ntuple"  -- Can be used to turn off creation and filling of
                         the ntuple of results (useful for debugging purposes
                         only). Default value is 1 (fill the ntuple).

"process_tcl_events"  -- If set to 1, tcl events will be processed during
                         integration. Default is 0.

"debug_level"         -- Defines the verbosity of various diagnostic
                         messages. Set to 0 in order to turn off all such
                         messages. Default is 10.

"jes_min"             -- These parameters define the JES scanning grid in
"jes_max"                units of sigma. Default values are -5.1, 5.1, and
"n_jes_points"           51, respectively. This results in a scan from
                         -5 to 5 sigma with the step of 0.2.

"topscan_min"         -- These parameters define the top mass scanning
"topscan_max"            grid. Default values are 111.0, 239.0, and 64.
"topscan_points"         This scans from 112 GeV to 238 GeV with 2 GeV
                         step. Note that this scan corresponds to the
                         top masses for which we have generated large
                         samples of Pythia HEPG events.

"permute_jets"        -- If set to 0, the code will not permute jets.
                         If set to 1, the code will make sure that the
                         b-tagged jets are assigned to b partons.
                         If set to something else, the code will use
                         all permutations weighted by the tag probability.

"light_jet_mass"      -- These parameters are used to set the masses of
"lep_b_jet_mass"         the partons when the integration over the parton
"had_b_jet_mass"         masses is turned off. When permutations are also
                         turned off, one can set these numbers to negative
                         values. In this case the code will pick up correct
                         parton masses from HEPG. The default values are
                         0.0, 4.8, and 4.8, respectively.

"cms_energy"          -- The center-of-mass energy of the collision. The
                         default value of this parameter is 1960.0.

"matrel_code"         -- Defines which matrix element (ME) to use. Reasonable
                         vaues of this parameter are 5 (use Kleiss-Stirling
                         ME) and 3 (use Mahlon-Parke ME). Other values are
                         reserved for testing purposes.

"top_width"           -- These are the parameters of top and W mass
"nominal_w_mass"         Breit-Wigners. The default values are 1.2,
"nominal_w_width"        80.42, and 2.12, respectively.

"parton_syserr_pt_cutoff" -- This parameter determines the minimum Pt
                         value for determining the systematic error using
                         the parton information only. If the parton has
                         Pt less than this cutoff, the cutoff value will
                         be used instead of parton Pt. The default value
                         of this parameter is 21.0.

"wlep_npoints"        -- Number of points in the leptonic MW^2 grid. This
                         is the only regular grid in the quasi-MC integrator.
                         It has to stay regular because the phase space
                         factor diverges at the MW^2 phase space boundary,
                         so the boundary must be carefully taken care of
                         by switching to nu_z integration. The default
                         value of 7 is probably insufficient for precision
                         integration.

                         If this parameter is set to 1 then the code will
                         use the value "hepg_mwlep" provided as the
                         argument to the "mc_top_jes_scan" function.

"wlep_coverage"       -- The coverage of the partial leptonic MW^2 grid.
                         The "whole" grid covers the leptonic MW range
                         between 0 and the mass of the leptonic top.
                         The "partial" grid used by the integration code
                         covers "wlep_coverage" part of the Breit-Wigner
                         between 0 and Mt. The default value is 0.99.

"whad_coverage"       -- Coverage of the hadronic MW^2 grid. The default
                         value of this parameter is 0.998. The point will
                         be rejected if the random MW value is negative or
                         exceeds the hadronic top mass.

"thad_coverage"       -- Coverages of the Mt grids. The default value for
"tlep_coverage"          both parameters is 0.98.

"eta_q_sigma_factor"  -- These are the correction factors for angular
"phi_q_sigma_factor"     resolution modeling. They can be used to adjust
"eta_b_sigma_factor"     the width of the corresponding angular transfer
"phi_b_sigma_factor"     functions when the parton masses are _not_
                         integrated over (see "random_jet_angles.h" header).
                         When the parton masses _are_ integrated over,
                         different angular transfer functions are used
                         which depend on the parton mass (see header
                         "angular_transfer_function.h"). In this case
                         one has to use the "adjust_angular_tf_width" tcl
                         command in order to change the width. The format
                         of this command is explained later in this text.

"param_grid_absolute" -- If this parameter is set to 0 then the lower
                         and upper limits for integration over log(pq/pqbar)
                         will be shifted by the observed value of
                         log(pq/pqbar). For example, if observed value
                         of pq is 80 and observed value of pqbar is 40
                         then the log(pq/pqbar) integration range will
                         be from mc_rel_param_min + log(2) to
                         mc_rel_param_max + log(2). In the 3-jet mode
                         the shift will not be performed in case one
                         of the "missing" jets is q or qbar. The default
                         value of this parameter is 0.

"prob_factor"         -- The overall factor by which the likelihood is
                         multiplied. Useful for keeping the results
                         within the dynamic range of "float" instead
                         of double. The default value 2.0e9 seems
                         to be appropriate for the 4-jet integration.

"skipevents"          -- Number of events to skip at the beginning of
                         the file.

"maxevents"           -- Maximum number of events to process. Note that
                         skipped events are counted towards the maximum.
                         The default is a very large number (INT_MAX).

"periodic_script"     -- One can run a tcl script (in the global context)
"script_period"          every "script_period" events. By default, no
                         such script is run.

"category"            -- Histo-Scope category for the result ntuples.
                         Default value is "Work".

"sample_pole_mass" -- This parameter can be useful when the integration
                      over top mass Breit-Wigners is turned off. When
                      this parameter is set, the kinematic solvers will
                      know and use the exact difference between the HEPG
                      top quark masses and the pole mass. The default
                      value of this parameter is 0 which means that the
                      sample pole mass is unknown (as in the data).

"mc_rand_method"  -- Determines the quasi (or pseudo) random number
                     generator used to build the integration grid.
                     The following values are currently allowed: "sobol",
                     "scramsobol", "fortsobol", "halton", "nieder",
                     and "drand48". These values mean the following:

                     "sobol" -- use the Sobol low-discrepancy sequence.
                                This is the default.

                     "scramsobol" -- use the Sobol sequence with additional
                                bit scrambling by a linear congruential
                                generator (LCG). This method does not
                                preserve the "low discrepancy" property of
                                the sequence and, therefore, can not be
                                recommended. The LCG multiplier can be set
                                by the "set_sobol_scrambling_multiplier"
                                tcl command.

                     "fortsobol" -- use the Sobol sequence with other types
                                of bit scrambling (which do preserve the
                                "low discrepancy" property but do not solve
                                the problem of low-dimensional substructure
                                completely). The type of scrambling to use
                                is specified by the "mc_random_gen_param"
                                parameter.

                     "halton" -- use the Halton low-discrepancy sequence.

                     "nieder" -- use the scrambled Niederreiter sequence.

                     "drand48" -- Use the "drand48" random number generator
                                from Linux. When "drand48" is used, the
                                integration scheme becomes very similar to
                                a normal MC-based integration. The grid,
                                however, is built just once and then later
                                reused for all permutations and all events.

"mc_random_gen_param"  -- An integer parameter given to the random
                     number generator initialization code. The meaning
                     of this parameter depends on the generator specified
                     by the "mc_rand_method" parameter:

                     "sobol", "scramsobol" and "halton" -- The value is
                                the number of points to skip at the beginning
                                of the sequence. This allows the generator
                                to "warm up". One common strategy is to set
                                this parameter to the smallest power of 2
                                which is equal to or greater than
                                "mc_max_points".

                     "fortsobol" and "nieder" -- If the parameter value is
                                between 0 and 3, it is used to indicate
                                the type of bit scrambling:
                                0 : no scrambling
                                1 : Owen type scrambling
                                2 : Faure-Tezuka type scrambling
                                3 : Owen + Faure-Tezuka type scrambling
                                For details, see TOMS algorithm 823 and
                                comments inside the "sobol_f.f" file.
                                If the parameter value is 4 or larger,
                                it is treated as the number of points to
                                skip at the beginning of an unscrambled
                                sequence, similar to the case of "sobol"
                                generator.

                     "drand48" -- Any number except 0 means to use that number
                                as the "srand48" random seed. If the number
                                is 0, it is assumed that "drand48" will be
                                initialized from a default seed (or has
                                already been initialized by some other code).

                     The default value of this parameter is 0.

"mc_max_points"   -- The maximum number of points one expects to use
                     in the integration grid. This should not exceed
                     a few millions because the whole grid will be
                     stored in memory, and it can use up to 80 bytes
                     per point. The default value is 262144.

"mc_min_points"   -- Minimum number of grid points to use before
                     running any integration convergence checks.
                     Normally, the code will integrate over all
                     permutations before any checks are run. The
                     default value is 1024.

"mc_check_factor" -- This parameter defines how often the system is
                     going to check for integral convergence.
                     It is multiplied by the number of grid points
                     integrated up to now to get the number of points
                     after which the check is performed again. For
                     example, if this parameter is set to 1.2, and the
                     "mc_min_points" parameter is set to 1024 then
                     the checks will be performed after 1024 points
                     are sampled, 1228 points, 1473 points, etc.
                     Default "mc_check_factor" value is 2.

"mc_worst_perm_cutoff" -- This parameter controls, roughly, how many
                     permutations are integrated over between convergence
                     checks. The convergence check code estimates the
                     integration error for each permutation and for
                     each point in the Mt/JES space. Each permutation
                     can be the largest error contributor for each
                     Mt/JES point. Let say, permutation A is the largest
                     error contributor for N Mt/JES points, and this N
                     is the largest among all permutations. Then
                     permutation A will be integrated over in the
                     next check cycle. If permutation B is the largest
                     error contributor for M points then permutation B
                     will be integrated over if N/M < mc_worst_perm_cutoff.
                     (N/M is calculated using floating point arithmetic).
                     Note that, by definition, N/M >= 1, so setting the
                     "mc_worst_perm_cutoff" parameter to something less
                     than 1 will ensure that  the code integrates only
                     the single permutation which contributes the largest
                     error to the largest number of Mt/JES points. The
                     default value of "mc_worst_perm_cutoff" parameter
                     is 2.

"mc_precision_fraction" -- These two parameters define the integration
"mc_precision_target"    precision to aim at. The likelihood values of
                         "mc_precision_fraction" fraction of points
                     with the highest values in the mt and JES space
                     should be determined with "mc_precision_target"
                     or better relative precision for the integration
                     to converge successfully. The default value of
                     "mc_precision_fraction" is 0.9, and the default
                     value of "mc_precision_target" is 0.02. Unfortunately,
                     we do not know how to determine convergence reliably
                     for the quasi-MC integration, and use the pseudo-MC
                     estimate instead. The "mc_precision_target" of 0.02
                     is definitely too low for practical purposes when Sobol
                     sequence is used.

"mc_max_event_seconds"  -- Maximum number of seconds allowed before
                     the integration of an event times out. The default
                     is INT_MAX which means that the integration will
                     not time out and will be terminated due to some
                     other reason. Note that the event is checked
                     for timeout only with the periodicity defined
                     by "mc_check_factor", so that an event can actually
                     use more time than this parameter says.

"mc_max_zeroprob_pts" -- This parameter allows for fast termination
                     of event integration in case the likelihood
                     curve looks empty. Only "mc_max_zeroprob_pts"
                     will be sampled in this case. Default value of
                     this parameter is four times mc_min_points value.

"mc_mwsq_safety_margin" -- The difference between MW^2 on the leptonic
                     side and the phase space boundary. Near the boundary
                     solutions of various kinematic equations become
                     numerically unstable. The points closer to the
                     boundary than mc_mwsq_safety_margin will get 0 weight.
                     The default value of this parameter is 0.01.

"mc_fudge_to_treelevel" -- If set to 1, the code will attempt to
                     reconstruct a tree-level event from ID94 event.
                     The matrix element will then be evaluated on
                     this tree-level event. The default is 0.

"mc_nominal_q_mass" -- The light parton mass to use during reconstruction
                     of the tree-level event when "mc_fudge_to_treelevel"
                     parameter is set to 1. Default is 0.0.

"mc_nominal_b_mass" -- The b parton mass to use during reconstruction
                     of the tree-level event when "mc_fudge_to_treelevel"
                     parameter is set to 1. Default is 4.8.

"mc_had_mt_gen_type" -- These parameters define the types of the top mass
"mc_lep_mt_gen_type"    grids on the hadronic and leptonic sides. They are
                        not meaningful right now because only Breit-Wigner
                        grids with fixed width are supported at this point.

"mc_abs_param_min" -- These parameters define lower and upper limits
"mc_abs_param_max"    for integration over log(pq/pqbar). "abs" or
"mc_rel_param_min"    "rel" parameters are used, depending on whether
"mc_rel_param_max"    the parameter grid is relative to the observed
                      value of log(pq/pqbar) or absolute. Note that
                      in the 3-jet integration mode the grid is
                      necessarily absolute when one of the light jets
                      is considered to be absent. Reasonable values for
                      these parameters should be chosen by looking at
                      the log(pq/pqbar) distributions. The defaults are
                      -4.0, 4.0, -2.0, and 2.0, respectively.

"mc_efficiency_mask" -- Bits of this mask define which efficiency functions
                        will be applied (if the corresponding bit is set to 1)
                        and which will not be (if the bit is set to 0).
                        bit 0 -- corresponds to the opening angle efficiency
                                 for W daughters.
                        Other bits are reserved for future use.

"nu_momentum_cutoff"    -- These parameters set various limits needed to
"q_momentum_cutoff"        avoid phase space singularities. Do not modify
"had_phase_space_cutoff"   the default values unless you really know what
"detlepNu_cutoff"          you are doing.
"detlepW_cutoff"

One possible technique for increasing the overall integration speed
consists of trying to figure out the values of ttbar Pt which lead
to allowed kinematic configurations on the leptonic side, before
calculating everything else. My preliminary experiments indicate that
by doing this the overall code speed can be increased by factor of two
or so. The following parameters specify the details of the method:

"mc_lside_b_conesize"  -- The size of the eta-phi cone around the b jet
                          direction within which the solutions are searched.
                          Default value of this parameter is 0.7.

"mc_lside_b_tailsize"  -- This parameter determines, roughly, how large
                          leptonic b parton momentum can be compared to
                          the jet momentum. If the parton momentum is very
                          large then the probability for the jet momentum
                          to fluctuate below the observed value becomes
                          very small. This parameter tells us how small this
                          probability can be so that it is still reasonable
                          to consider that large parton momentum in the
                          ttbar Pt scan. Default value of this parameter
                          is 0.01.

"mc_lside_mask_nPhi"   -- Number of the phi bins in the ttbar Pt scan.
                          Default is 64.

"mc_lside_mask_nPt"    -- Number of the Pt bins in the ttbar Pt scan.
                          Default is 64.

"mc_lside_rand_method" -- This parameter has the same meaning for the ttbar
                          Pt scan and can take the same values as the
                          "mc_rand_method" parameter for the overall
                          intergration. Default value of this parameter
                          is "sobol".

"mc_lside_rnd_param"   -- This parameter has the same meaning for the ttbar
                          Pt scan and can take the same values as the
                          "mc_random_gen_param" parameter for the overall
                          intergration. Default value of this parameter is 0.

"mc_lside_max_points"  -- Maximum number of tries in the ttbar Pt scan.
                          Default is 2^19 = 524288. Note that the scanning
                          is done using a quasi-MC sequence, so this number
                          has to be "good" for the sequence used. There
                          should probably be at least 100 points for each
                          bin in the scan (the total number of bins is
                          mc_lside_mask_nPhi*mc_lside_mask_nPt).

"mc_lside_max_seconds" -- Maximum number of wall-clock seconds allowed for
                          the ttbar Pt scan for a specific leptonic b jet
                          assumption (there will be N such assumptions for
                          an event with N jets). Default value of 0 means
                          that ttbar Pt scan is turned off. It is reasonable
                          to allow 3 min or so for this scan if the overall
                          event integration time limit is on the order of
                          one hour.

"mc_lside_nuz_min"     -- Minumum neutrino Pz value for the ttbar Pt
                          kinematic scan. Default is -400.0.

"mc_lside_nuz_max"     -- Maximum neutrino Pz value for the ttbar Pt
                          kinematic scan. Default is 400.0.

"mc_lside_pt_max"      -- Maximum ttbar Pt value for the ttbar Pt kinematic
                          scan. Default is 500.0.

In order to turn on the ttbar Pt kinematic scan, the following
conditions must be satisfied: all of the "mc_lside_mask_nPhi",
"mc_lside_mask_nPt", and "mc_lside_max_seconds" parameter values must
be positive, and the integrator must not be in the "tau+jets" mode
(that is, parameter "mc_grid_mask_tau" must be 0).

The parameters relevant in the 3-jet integration mode are listed below.
The 3-jet integration mode can be turned on by setting both the
"mc_prob_to_acquire_jet" parameter and the "mc_prob_to_loose_parton"
parameter to something other than "none".

"mc_excluded_jet" -- Should be "q", "qbar", "blep", "bhad", or "none".
                     This parameter is used for testing 3-jet integration
                     code when permutations are turned off. The default
                     value is "none" (corresponds to the 4-jet mode).
                     Note that this default value is unacceptable when
                     the 3-jet mode is used without permuting jets.
                     When jet permutations are turned on, this parameter
                     is ignored.

"discard_excluded_jet"   -- Boolean parameter which can be set on or off.
                     Used to test whether the top mass library code is
                     sensitive to the excluded jet information (it should
                     not be). Default value of this parameter is 0.

"mc_prob_to_acquire_jet" -- Defines which function to use in order
                     to calculate the probability to pick up an extra
                     jet in the 3-jet integration mode. Currently
                     supported values are "unit" and "none". "unit"
                     means that this probability is set to 1 (useful
                     for tests) and "none" should be used in the
                     4-jet integration mode. The default is "none".

"mc_prob_to_loose_parton" -- Defines which function to use in order
                     to calculate the probability to loose a parton
                     (not to see the jet it produces). Currently
                     supported values are "unit", "tf_eff", and "none".
                     "unit" means that this probability is set to 1
                     (useful for tests). "tf_eff" means that this
                     probability is calculated using the value of
                     a cumulative transfer function above a cutoff.
                     "none" should be used in the 4-jet integration mode.

The following parameters set up the partucular behavior of the
"prob_to_loose_parton" function. Their meaning is specific to each
function used. For the "tf_eff" function they mean:

"mc_pt_cut"         -- The nominal value of the jet Pt cut. The default
                       value is 20.0.

"mc_eta_cut"        -- The nominal value of the jet eta cut. The default
                       value is 2.0.

"mc_max_efficiency" -- The maximum efficiency to reconstruct a jet. Think
                       of it as of the level of the plateau reached by the
                       jet reconstruction efficiency as a function of
                       parton Pt. The default value is 1.0.

"mc_jes_sigma_factor" -- This factor converts JES deviation from 1 in
                         units of sigma near the "mc_pt_cut" into absolute
                         JES deviation. Default value is 0.03 (which is
                         clearly not right).

The mask parameters below can be used to turn on and off integration
in various dimensions. By default, all dimensions are turned on except
the tau momentum (which is meaningful for the tau+jets assumption only).

"mc_grid_mask_param"    -- Turns on and off integration in log(pq/pqbar).
                           If the integration is turned off, the code
                           uses the value provided as the "hepg_param"
                           argument to the "mc_top_jes_scan" function.

"mc_grid_mask_whad"     -- Turns on and off integration in MW^2 for
                           the hadronic side. If the integration is turned
                           off, the code uses the value provided as the
                           "hepg_mwhad" argument to the "mc_top_jes_scan"
                           function.

"mc_grid_mask_tau"      -- Set this to 1 for tau+jets assumption

"mc_grid_mask_ttbarpt"  -- If 1, integrate over Pt ttbar. If 0 then
                           ttbar Pt will be taken from HEPG.

"mc_grid_mask_toplep"   -- Set this to 0 in order to turn off the
                           integration over leptonic top mass.

"mc_grid_mask_tophad"   -- Set this to 0 in order to turn off the
                           integration over hadronic top mass. It
                           probably makes sense to turn it off here
                           because we will later convolute the
                           results with Breit-Wigner anyway.

"mc_grid_mask_mq"       -- These four turn on and off integrations over
"mc_grid_mask_mqbar"       the parton masses. Note that changing between
"mc_grid_mask_mbhad"       integrating and not integrating over the
"mc_grid_mask_mblep"       parton masses requires a change in the calorimeter
                           transfer functions and a recompilation because
                           the transfer functions depend on the parton mass.

"mc_grid_mask_angle_q"  -- These four turn on and off integrations over
"mc_grid_mask_angle_qbar"  the corresponding parton angles.
"mc_grid_mask_angle_bhad"
"mc_grid_mask_angle_blep"

The code can be used to integrate events with 5 jets. The 5-jet
integration mode is currently experimental. In the MC scan file it can
be turned on by setting the "add_random_jet" parameter to 1. In the
data scan file it is turned on automatically when the number of tight
jets is 5. The "mc_prob_to_acquire_jet" parameter must be set to something
other than "none". Both "mc_excluded_jet" and "mc_prob_to_loose_parton"
parameters must be set to "none". Note that the random jet is created
"on the fly", so that correct initialization of the random number
generator becomes critical.


Other Configuration Options
---------------------------

Some transfer function codes allow direct manipulation of the transfer
function parameters from tcl. The following commands are provided by
the top mass library tcl API for this purpose: "set_tf_parameters" and
"adjust_angular_tf_width". The tcl "set_tf_parameters" command is just
an interface to the "set_tf_parameters" C functions declared in the
"transfer_function.h" header. The tcl API combines all "set_tf_parameters"
arguments into an array of doubles and passes this array (together
with the number of elements) to the "set_tf_parameters" C function.
The meaning of the parameters is up to the C code which implements the
transfer function. The last set of parton-mass-dependent Pt/Pt transfer
functions has five adjustable parameters, in the order listed below:

tf_pt_cutoff   -- The jet Pt cut value used to define tight jets.
                  The default value of this parameter is 20.0.

min_pred_value -- Minimum value of the transfer function momentum predictor,
                  currently Pt. If the parton Pt is below this value,
                  the transfer function at the minimum value is used.
                  Default value of this parameter is 12.0.

max_pred_value -- Maximum value of the transfer function momentum predictor.
                  If the parton Pt is above this value, the transfer
                  function at the maximum value is used. Default value
                  of this parameter is 200.0.

max_jet_m94_q  -- Maximum value of the transfer function mass predictor
                  for light jets. Default value is 60.0.

max_jet_m94_b  -- Maximum value of the transfer function mass predictor
                  for b jets. Default value is 80.0.

The tcl "adjust_angular_tf_width" command can be used to change the
standard deviation of the parton-mass-dependent angular transfer
functions. The usage is like this:

adjust_angular_tf_width which_angle isB factor

where "which_angle" is either "eta" or "phi", "isB" is a boolean
parameter which specifies whether we are adjusting the width for b or
light jet, and "factor" is a factor by which the width should be adjusted.
For example, the command to increase the width of the light jet eta
transfer function by 5% looks like this:

adjust_angular_tf_width eta 0 1.05

Note that, since eta transfer functions are not symmetric about 0,
the mean will be shifted as well.
