In order to use "gprof" with the top mass library, one has to compile
the library with the "-pg" switch and to link it statically into an
executable. Note that using "sprof" is also non-trivial: tcl manages
the shared librarires itself instead of using the dynamic linker, so
the usual way of generating the shared library profile (by setting
LD_PROFILE and LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT environment) does not work.

The sequence of steps is as follows. Note that various Makefile.profile
makefiles have not been adapted yet for use on fcdflnx6.

1) If you have not yet done so, generate "data_integ_mtm3.c" from the
   template using "compile_driver.tcl" script. This step requires that
   you have normal, shared versions of JetUser and Tmasslib libraries.

2) Create the static, profiled version of the JetUser package:

   cd JetUser (substitute proper path)
   make clean
   make -f Makefile.profile

3) Create the static, profiled version of the top mass library:

   cd Tmasslib (substitute proper path)
   make clean
   make -f Makefile.profile

4) Compile the "mtm3sh" executable in this directory:

   make -f Makefile.profile

5) Set up the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment for running the "mtm3sh" executable
   (this is not yet adapted for fcdflnx6):

   source setup.csh

6) Run the "mt_test_scan.tcl" script by mtm3sh (instead of by itself which
   would invoke tclsh):

mtm3sh mt_test_scan.tcl data_parameters_fullscan.tcl ../Transfer_functions ttkt70_gen6_100ev.hs myscan.hs 1024 2

7) Process the profile data by "gprof":

rm -f gmon.txt
gprof mtm3sh gmon.out > gmon.txt

8) Examine the "gmon.txt" file.
